# File Conventions — {{PROJECT_TITLE}}

> **When to read this file:** When creating new files, naming artifacts, or setting up workspace directories. Not needed for every turn.

## General Rules

- All artifacts are markdown files
- File names use lowercase-hyphenated format
- Draft iterations append a version suffix: `chapter-01-v1.md`, `chapter-01-v2.md`
- QC verdicts use consistent format: PASS / CONDITIONAL PASS / FAIL with per-item findings
- Reference materials live in `/reference/scoping-notes/`

## Naming Rules

These rules govern all file creation. They take precedence over any implicit convention.

**Rule 1 — Section prefix and subdirectory are mandatory.** Every artifact filename in a stage directory (`preparation/`, `execution/`, `analysis/`, `report/`, `final/`) starts with `{section}-`. Every artifact goes inside a `{section}/` subdirectory within its parent directory (e.g., `execution/raw-reports/1.1/1.1-session-a-raw-report.md`). No loose files at stage root — every artifact belongs in a named subdirectory. Files in `reference/`, `logs/`, and `output/` are exempt — they are project-scoped, not section-scoped.

**Rule 2 — Variant suffix convention.** When a step produces a derived version of an existing artifact, the name is the base canonical pattern plus a variant suffix before the extension. Recognized variant suffixes: `-refined`, `-cited`, `-ctl`, `-verification`. Example: `{section}-cluster-NN-memo.md` → `{section}-cluster-NN-memo-refined.md`. A variant does not need its own row in the canonical table — it inherits from the base pattern.

**Rule 3 — Unknown artifact protocol.** If you are about to write a file and no canonical pattern matches (even with variant suffixes), construct the name from the General File Naming Convention below, write the file, AND add a new row to the Canonical Naming Standard table in this file. The table must stay complete — every artifact type that exists in the repo must have a corresponding pattern.

## Canonical Naming Standard

Every artifact follows a predictable pattern so commands and hooks can locate files mechanically. NN is always zero-padded two digits (01, 02, ...).

## General File Naming Convention

For any output NOT covered by the canonical naming standard:

```
[section-number]-[descriptive-name]-v[version].md
```

**Rules:**
- Section number first — matches project plan numbering (e.g., 1.1, 2.3)
- Descriptive name in kebab-case — lowercase, hyphens, no spaces or underscores
- Version last — uses `v` prefix with minor versions (v0.1 → v0.8 → v1.0)
- v0.x = draft/in-progress, v1.0 = first complete version, v1.1+ = revisions
- Every output gets a version from the start
- When updating a file — increment version in filename, don't overwrite without versioning

## Workspace Organization

All files go in clearly named folders — never leave loose files in stage roots or the repo root.

  enrichment/{section}/
  compiled/{section}/          (Stage-5 compiled sources and final deliverable)
  produced/{section}/R{N}/     (Stage-5 prose-refinement and formatting outputs)
    working/                   (Stage-5 intermediate working files)

reference/              (project-scoped, no section subdirs)
  skills/
  sops/
  templates/
  scoping-notes/

logs/                   (project-scoped, no section subdirs)

output/                 (project-scoped, no section subdirs)
  knowledge-files/
```

### Rules

- When starting a new section, create `{section}/` subdirectories inside each artifact directory as needed. Do not pre-create all subdirectories — create them when the stage produces its first artifact.
- `reference/`, `logs/`, and `output/` are project-scoped — no section subdirectories.
- Additional folders use descriptive kebab-case names.

**Cleanup rule:** Before ending a session, delete scratch/temporary files not needed going forward. Ask before deleting if unsure.
