Build a research context pack. The section identifier follows this prompt (e.g., "1.1").

**Standalone command — external consumer.** This command's output (`/execution/context-packs/{section}-context-pack.md`) is consumed externally by Research Execution GPT (CustomGPT) or Perplexity research sessions — not by an in-pipeline Claude Code command. The operator manually loads or pastes the context pack into the external research session. There is no internal `/intake-context-pack` or downstream pipeline command that reads this output.

## Instructions

1. Read `/ai-resources/skills/context-pack-builder/SKILL.md` and follow its principles.
2. Read the approved Task Plan for the specified section from `/preparation/`.
3. Build a context pack for GPT-5 research execution using the Task Plan as source material.
4. Write output to `/execution/context-packs/{section}-context-pack.md`. Create the folder if it doesn't exist.
5. Filename must follow the project naming convention: section number first (e.g., `1.1-context-pack.md`).

## Context Pack Purpose

The context pack provides project background for search orientation ONLY. It is NOT an Answer Spec. Answer Specs arrive separately per execution batch and carry all execution-level detail including:
- Source requirements and evidence rules
- Depth calibration per question
- Scope narrowing and geographic specificity
- Terminology and framing guidance
- Completion gates and grading criteria

Do not duplicate or anticipate Answer Spec content in the context pack.

## Required Sections

1. **Purpose statement** — what this pack is (and isn't)
2. **Project background** — enough for GPT to orient its searches
3. **Key terminology** — short definitions of domain-specific terms that GPT needs to interpret correctly (e.g., "boutique PE fund", "Nordic PE", "mid-market"). Extract from the Task Plan and Research Plan. Define only terms where the project uses a specific or narrower meaning than the general usage.
4. **Content map** — the parts/chapters structure so GPT understands where each batch sits
5. **Scope boundaries** — what's in and out of scope at the project level

Keep it lean.
