Execute the Stage 4 report production pipeline.

Prerequisite check: Verify chapter drafts exist in `/analysis/chapters/{section}/`, memos/directives are approved in the QC log, and editorial recommendations (Step 3.6b/3.6c) are approved. This command expects a fresh session after `/run-synthesis` completes.

Skill loading: For each skill step below, read the skill file from `/ai-resources/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions.

---

### Step 4.0: Load Inputs

1. Read all chapter drafts from `/analysis/chapters/{section}/`.
2. Read the scarcity register from `/execution/scarcity-register/{section}/{section}-scarcity-register.md` (if it exists).
3. Read all section directives from `/analysis/section-directives/{section}/`.
4. Read all refined cluster memos from `/analysis/cluster-memos/{section}/`.
5. Read all research extracts from `/execution/research-extracts/{section}/`.
6. Read approved editorial recommendations from `/analysis/editorial-review/{section}/{section}-memo-review-recommendations.md`.

These inputs are referenced throughout the pipeline. Sub-agents receive content, not file paths (per context isolation rules).

---

### Step 4.1: Create Report Architecture [delegate]

1. Read chapter drafts (loaded in Step 4.0).
2. Read `/ai-resources/skills/research-structure-creator/SKILL.md`.
3. Launch a general-purpose sub-agent. Pass it: the skill content and all chapter draft content. Task: execute the skill logic to produce the report architecture. Write to `/report/architecture/{section}/{section}-architecture.md`. Return: architecture summary (section count, chapter-to-section mapping, structural decisions).
4. Write checkpoint to `/report/checkpoints/{section}/{section}-step-4.1-checkpoint.md` from the sub-agent's returned summary. Include: output file path, section count, chapter-to-section mapping with chapter processing order.
5. ▸ /compact — skill content and raw chapter drafts no longer needed; checkpoint carries forward.
6. PAUSE — Present architecture to the operator for review.

---

### Step 4.1b: Architecture QC [delegate-qc]

1. Read `/ai-resources/skills/architecture-qc/SKILL.md`.
2. Read all inputs needed for the QC: the architecture (`/report/architecture/{section}/{section}-architecture.md`), scarcity register (`/execution/scarcity-register/{section}/{section}-scarcity-register.md`), all section directives from `/analysis/section-directives/{section}/`, approved editorial recommendations (`/analysis/editorial-review/{section}/{section}-memo-review-recommendations.md`), and all chapter drafts from `/analysis/chapters/{section}/`.
3. Launch a qc-gate sub-agent. Pass it: the skill content, the architecture content, scarcity register content, section directives content, editorial recommendations content, and chapter draft content. Task: evaluate the architecture against all 14 criteria and produce the QC report.
4. Write QC report to `/report/checkpoints/{section}/{section}-step-4.1b-architecture-qc.md`.
5. If Overall Verdict is FAIL with critical findings: PAUSE — present failures to the operator. Architecture must be fixed before proceeding.
6. If Overall Verdict is PASS: note result and proceed to Step 4.2.
7. ▸ /compact — QC skill content no longer needed.

### Step 4.2: Produce Chapter Prose (per chapter, sequentially in architecture order)

Process chapters in the order defined by the architecture from Step 4.1.

For each chapter:

**a. Draft chapter prose [delegate]**
   Read `/ai-resources/skills/evidence-to-report-writer/SKILL.md`. Launch a general-purpose sub-agent. Pass it: the skill content, architecture (`/report/architecture/{section}/{section}-architecture.md`), the chapter's research extracts (from `/execution/research-extracts/{section}/`), the chapter's cluster memo, the chapter's section directive, the scarcity register (`/execution/scarcity-register/{section}/{section}-scarcity-register.md`), approved editorial recommendations, AND the style reference from `/report/style-reference/{section}/{section}-style-reference.md` (all chapters — the style spec is operator-provided and applies from chapter 1 onward). The writer MUST implement the editorial instruction (HEDGE / SCOPE CAVEAT / PROXY FRAMING) specified in the scarcity register for any scarcity items in this chapter's scope. Task: produce chapter prose. Return: chapter draft content, scarcity items addressed, evidence coverage notes.

**b. Review chapter prose [delegate]**
   Read `/ai-resources/skills/chapter-prose-reviewer/SKILL.md`. Launch a general-purpose sub-agent. Pass it: the skill content, the chapter draft from step (a), AND the scarcity register. The reviewer must verify that scarcity editorial instructions were implemented correctly. Task: apply the reviewer checks. Return: review verdict, findings list, recommended changes.

**c. Compliance QC [delegate-qc]**
   Read `/ai-resources/skills/report-compliance-qc/SKILL.md`. Launch a qc-gate sub-agent. Pass it: the skill content, the chapter draft, review findings from step (b), the architecture (`/report/architecture/{section}/{section}-architecture.md`), the style reference from `/report/style-reference/{section}/{section}-style-reference.md`, the scarcity register (`/execution/scarcity-register/{section}/{section}-scarcity-register.md`), and the chapter's section directive from `/analysis/section-directives/{section}/`. Task: run all four compliance check categories per the skill criteria. Return: QC verdict (PASS/FAIL), per-item findings.

**d. Write chapter and checkpoint**
   Write to `/report/chapters/{section}/{section}-chapter-NN.md`.
   Write checkpoint to `/report/checkpoints/{section}/{section}-chapter-NN-checkpoint.md` Include: output file path, QC verdict, reviewer findings summary, scarcity items addressed.

**e. PAUSE** — Present chapter to the operator for review.

**f. Bright-line check on any revisions:** Before applying revision feedback, check each proposed change against the three bright-line triggers (multi-paragraph scope, analytical claim alteration, sourced statement modification). Flag any that trigger. Apply only non-flagged changes automatically; flagged changes require explicit approval. Log flagged items to `/logs/decisions.md`.

**g. Style reference verification (first chapter only):** After first chapter is approved, verify that the prose conforms to the operator-provided style reference at `/report/style-reference/{section}/{section}-style-reference.md`. The style reference is pre-locked — do not overwrite it. All chapters receive it as input in steps (a), (b), and (c).

**h. H3 title generation.**

**i. Citation conversion [delegate]**
   Read `/ai-resources/skills/citation-converter/SKILL.md`. Launch a general-purpose sub-agent. Pass it: the skill content and the approved chapter prose. Task: execute citation conversion. Write cited version to `/report/chapters/{section}/{section}-chapter-NN-cited.md` and Citation Traceability Layer to `/report/chapters/{section}/{section}-chapter-NN-ctl.md`. Return: citation count, CTL summary.
   Write checkpoint to `/report/checkpoints/{section}/{section}-chapter-NN-cited-checkpoint.md`. Include: cited file path, CTL file path, citation count.
   ▸ /compact — chapter-specific skill and input content no longer needed; moving to next chapter.

---

### Step 4.3: Log Results

1. Log to `/logs/qc-log.md`: record each chapter's QC verdict, citation count, and scarcity items addressed.
