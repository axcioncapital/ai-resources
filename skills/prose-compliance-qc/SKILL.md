# Prose Compliance QC

Compare prose output against three reference specs and surface gaps, violations, or cross-spec tensions. This is a compliance gate, not a diagnostic review — the skill identifies problems, it does not rewrite prose.

**Operating modes (named by the caller):**

- **Sequential mode** (standalone invocation): the prose has already been through `chapter-prose-reviewer` and any resulting fixes have been applied. Compliance violations flagged here are on top of a reviewed-and-fixed draft.
- **Merged mode** (inside `/produce-prose-draft` Phase 3): this skill and `chapter-prose-reviewer` run in the same subagent call against the *same unmodified prose*. When the caller names merged mode, treat the diagnostic review's findings as pending fixes — only flag as compliance violations items that would survive after those fixes are applied. Do not double-count issues the diagnostic review has already caught.

If the caller does not name a mode, default to Sequential mode and state the assumption in the output header.

**Position:** Phase 3 of `/produce-prose-draft`, where this skill and `chapter-prose-reviewer` are merged into a single review-and-fix subagent call. Formatting and H3 title generation run afterward in `/produce-formatting` (Phase 1 formatting, Phase 2 H3 titles). Historical note: this skill was originally positioned as Phase 4 of the monolithic `/produce-prose` command, which was split three ways on 2026-04-17 into `/produce-architecture`, `/produce-prose-draft`, and `/produce-formatting`.

## Inputs

All required unless noted. Prose and skill content are passed directly. Style Spec and Prose Quality Standards are passed as absolute file paths — read them from disk before running the scans.

### 1. Prose Draft (required)

The prose document to evaluate. This is the post-refinement version, meaning any fixes from the chapter-prose-reviewer pass have already been applied.

### 2. Chapter-Prose-Reviewer Skill (required)

The full content of `chapter-prose-reviewer/SKILL.md`. Used as an anti-pattern checklist for Scan 1, not as an execution engine. The QC does not run the reviewer; it uses the reviewer's named checks (ss1-ss5) as a reference list for its own pass/fail sweep.

### 3. Style Spec (required, blocking)

The style specification governing tone, voice, audience, formatting conventions, and prohibited patterns. **Passed as an absolute file path.** Read the file at the provided path before evaluating. If no path is provided, or the path does not resolve to a readable file, halt and request before evaluating.

### 4. Document Architecture Section Spec (optional)

The relevant section(s) from a document architecture. When provided, enables Full mode for Scan 3.

Must include (when available):
- Section thesis (one sentence)
- Target word count
- Must-land content
- What comes before and after this section
- Cross-reference requirements

**If not provided:** Scan 3 runs in Degraded mode. Input 5 (Source Decision Document) becomes required.

### 5. Source Decision Document (required when Input 4 is absent)

The approved decision document that was transformed into the prose draft. Enables Part 2-specific fidelity checks in Scan 3 Degraded mode.

**If both Input 4 and Input 5 are absent:** Halt. At least one of these must be provided for Scan 3 to run.

## Instructions

Run four scans in order, then produce the consolidated output.

## Scan 1: Skill Anti-Pattern Compliance

Sweep the prose against every named check in ss1-ss5 of the chapter-prose-reviewer skill (Input 2). For each check, assign one of:

- **CLEAR** — no instances found
- **VIOLATION** — quote the passage, name the check, state the problem in one sentence

Do not produce a full flag report. This is a pass/fail sweep. Only quote prose for violations.

Group results by evaluation section. List CLEAR checks as a single line per section:

```
ss1: [list of clear checks] — CLEAR
ss2: Evidence-summary pattern, Missing frame — CLEAR; Claim parade — VIOLATION [details]
```

Expand only violations.

### Checks to sweep (ss1–ss5)

For the full list of named checks under each evaluation section (ss1 Architecture, ss2 Structure and Argument, ss3 Style Spec Compliance, ss4 Prose Quality, ss5 Completeness and Fidelity), read [`references/anti-pattern-checks.md`](references/anti-pattern-checks.md). Sweep every check named there; treat the list as authoritative for Scan 1.

---

## Scan 2: Style Spec Compliance

Check every constraint stated in the style spec (Input 3). This is a mechanical check: if the spec says it, the prose must comply.

For each constraint:
- **COMPLIANT** — no violations found
- **VIOLATION** — quote the passage, state the specific constraint it breaks

Work through the spec systematically. Do not skip constraints because they seem minor.

Group COMPLIANT items together; expand only violations.

Pay particular attention to:
- **Prohibited patterns** — the spec may ban specific constructions, punctuation, or rhetorical moves (e.g., em dashes, announcement sentences, rhetorical questions)
- **Audience calibration** — terms undefined for the stated audience, or over-explanation for expert audiences
- **Voice register** — shifts in formality, hedging level, or assertiveness that break the stated voice
- **Sentence function test** — if the spec defines what every sentence must do (e.g., "state a design choice, explain reasoning, acknowledge uncertainty, or describe fund experience"), check for sentences that fail this test

---

## Scan 3: Architecture or Source Fidelity Compliance

This scan operates in two modes depending on whether Input 4 (architecture spec) is provided.

### Full Mode (Input 4 provided)

Check the prose against the document architecture section spec on four dimensions:

**Thesis delivery:** Is the section thesis from the architecture evident to the reader? Not buried, not implied. A reader should encounter it without needing to know what the section is trying to say.

**Must-land content:** Does the must-land finding receive the most prominent treatment? Could a reader skim the section and still encounter it? If it is buried mid-paragraph or subordinated to a less important point, flag it.

**Word count:** Is the prose within plus or minus 15% of the architecture target? If over, identify what could be compressed. If under, identify where depth is missing.

**Cross-references:** Are required cross-references to adjacent modules present, correctly pointed, and functional (the referenced content actually exists)?

### Degraded Mode (Input 4 absent, Input 5 provided)

Run Part 2-specific fidelity checks using the source decision document:

**Source fidelity:** Every design choice documented in the source's Decisions section (or argued in the body) appears in the prose output. Compare systematically: extract each decision from the source, verify it is present in the prose. Flag any dropped decisions.

**Scaffolding elimination:** No process artifacts remain in the prose:
- No metadata headers (Status, Session date, Dependencies, Feeds into, Co-dependent with, Draft version)
- No cross-reference codes (WH[N], OQ-[X]-[Y], DP[N], section numbers used as references like "2.4" or "1.4")
- No numbered decision summary lists
- No dependency tables
- No standalone Open Questions sections
- No dependency flag labels

**Uncertainty preservation:** Evidence calibration notes and acknowledged uncertainties from the source document survive in the prose. Check:
- Statements marked as "directional," "untested hypothesis," or "moderate confidence" in the source retain appropriate qualification in the prose
- Conditional gates and quality thresholds are preserved (these are substantive design decisions, not scaffolding)
- Open questions that represent genuine strategic uncertainties are integrated where relevant (not dropped)

**Internal cross-references:** Do references within the prose point to real content? A sentence that says "as established in the commercial model design" should correspond to content that actually appears in the referenced prose document.

---

## Scan 4: Cross-Spec Tensions

Review all violations found in Scans 1 through 3. Flag any case where fixing one violation would create or worsen another.

Common tension patterns:
- Cutting prose for word count compliance removes content needed for source fidelity or must-land prominence
- Adding contextual explanation for audience calibration pushes the section over word count or introduces scaffolding-like structure
- Simplifying language for audience accessibility weakens the analytical register required by the voice spec
- Removing a flagged anti-pattern (e.g., a catalogue structure) would leave a gap in the argument that the source document requires
- Restoring a dropped design choice (source fidelity) requires reintroducing process language the scaffolding elimination check flags

For each tension, state the competing requirements and suggest a resolution path. If no clean resolution exists, flag it as an escalation item for the operator.

If no cross-spec tensions are found, state "No cross-spec tensions identified."

---

## Output Format

Produce the consolidated output in four sections: **Per-Spec Verdicts** (table), **Mode Note** (which mode Scan 3 ran in), **Findings** (consolidated list ordered by severity HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), **Cross-Spec Tensions**, **Priority Fixes** (top 5).

For the full template — including the per-spec verdicts table layout, the per-finding entry format, severity definitions (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), the cross-spec tension entry format, and an abbreviated example output — read [`references/output-template.md`](references/output-template.md).

---

## Relationship to the Bright-Line Rule

This skill identifies problems. It does NOT apply fixes. Any fixes resulting from findings are subject to the bright-line rule:

1. Does the fix change more than one paragraph? Pause for operator approval.
2. Does the fix change, remove, or reframe an analytical claim? Pause for operator approval.
3. Does the fix alter a statement attributed to a source or carrying a claim ID? Pause for operator approval.

The proposed fix direction in each finding and in the Priority Fixes list should be a direction ("qualify this claim," "restore the missing design choice from the source"), not a rewritten passage.

---

## Failure Behavior

- **Missing style spec (Input 3):** Halt. Do not evaluate — style compliance is a primary dimension and cannot be skipped.
- **Both architecture spec and source document absent (Inputs 4 and 5):** Halt. Scan 3 requires at least one of these to run.
- **Chapter-prose-reviewer skill not provided (Input 2):** Halt. Scan 1 depends on the reviewer's named checks as its reference list.
- **Prose draft appears to be pre-refinement in Sequential mode:** Flag this to the operator. The Sequential-mode contract expects a reviewed-and-fixed draft; raw pre-refinement prose will produce findings the chapter-prose-reviewer pass would have caught. Proceed if instructed, but note in the output that findings may double-count issues a refinement pass would have resolved. (In Merged mode this is not a failure — pre-refinement prose is the expected input.)
- **Cross-reference target not available for verification:** Flag the specific reference as unverifiable. Do not guess whether the target content exists — state what is missing and mark the finding as conditional.

## Runtime Recommendations

- **Model:** No specific requirement — works with any Claude model.
- **Context:** Requires all inputs in context simultaneously. For long prose documents, the full draft plus all reference specs must fit in the context window.
- **Sequence:** Inside `/produce-prose-draft` Phase 3, runs in the same subagent call as `chapter-prose-reviewer` (diagnostic review and compliance scans operate against the same unmodified prose in a merged pass). Upstream of this phase: `decision-to-prose-writer` (Phase 2). Downstream: `ai-prose-decontamination` (Phase 5 of produce-prose-draft), then `prose-formatter` and `h3-title-pass` (Phases 1 and 2 of `/produce-formatting`).

## Calibration Notes

- If the provided information is insufficient to evaluate a specific constraint confidently (e.g., a cross-reference to a document that is not provided), say so rather than guessing. Flag what is missing and which findings are affected.
- For Part 2 prose in Degraded mode, the source fidelity check is the primary compliance dimension. A prose document that passes style and anti-pattern checks but drops design choices from the source is not compliant.
- If the prose scores zero violations across all three scans, state "No findings" under each scan. Do not manufacture feedback for excellent work.
