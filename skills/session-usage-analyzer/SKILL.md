  Analyzes a Claude Code session summary for token efficiency and produces a
  structured log entry for the project's logs/usage-log.md. Invoked as a
  subagent by the /usage-analysis command — receives a structured session
  summary and existing log contents, returns ONLY a formatted log entry.
  Do NOT invoke interactively or use for mid-session optimization. This is a
  post-session review tool.

## Role

Subagent evaluator. You receive a structured session summary and the current usage log from the calling agent. Analyze the session for token efficiency, identify waste patterns, and return a single log entry in the exact format specified below. No preamble, no commentary, no suggestions outside the entry.

## Input Requirements

The calling agent provides two inputs:

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Session summary | Yes | Structured fields listed in the schema below |
| Usage log contents | Yes | Full text of `logs/usage-log.md`, or the string `NEW LOG` if the file does not exist |

If the session summary is missing required fields, write `not reported` in the corresponding metric row. Do not infer or estimate missing data.

## Session Summary Schema

The calling agent builds this summary by scanning the conversation history before invoking the subagent.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Task** | Main work done this session (1-2 sentences) |
| **Date** | Session date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| **Approximate exchanges** | Count of human-to-Claude turns |
| **Files read** | Every file read via any tool, with approximate line count. Flag any file read more than once |
| **Files written or edited** | Files created or modified |
| **Tool calls** | Tools used with rough counts (e.g., "Read x7, Edit x3, Bash x4") |
| **Subagents** | Count and brief description of each subagent spawned |
| **Rework instances** | Cases where output was produced, then rejected or corrected and redone |
| **Notable patterns** | Anything else relevant — long outputs, repeated operations, large context loads |

## Efficiency Analysis Framework

Evaluate the session against five waste categories. For each, check the signals against the session summary and classify severity.

| Category | Signals | Severity Logic | Recommendation Template |
|----------|---------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Re-reads** | Same file read 2+ times without edits between reads | Moderate if 2x; Major if 3x+ or file >500 lines | "File X read N times — pin content or extract needed sections on first read" |
| **Rework** | Output produced then rejected, corrected, or redone | Moderate if 1 cycle; Major if >1 cycle on same artifact | "Artifact X required N rework cycles — clarify spec upfront or use outline-first approach" |
| **Context bloat** | Large files read in full when partial read would suffice; files read but never referenced in output | Minor if 1 file; Moderate if 2-3; Major if >3 or unreferenced reads exceed 50% of total | "N files read but unused in output — validate need before reading" |
| **Tool overhead** | Repeated tool calls that could be batched; tool calls producing unused output; wrong tool for the job | Minor if 1-2 wasted calls; Moderate if 3-5; Major if >5 | "N tool calls produced unused results — batch operations or select correct tool" |
| **Missed parallelization** | Sequential subagent launches or tool calls that had no dependency between them | Minor — informational only | "N independent operations ran sequentially — parallelize where possible" |

### Overall Efficiency Rating

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **Efficient** | 0 moderate or major findings |
| **Acceptable** | 1-2 moderate findings, 0 major |
| **Wasteful** | Any major finding OR 3+ moderate findings |

When the usage log contains previous entries, briefly note whether this session's rating represents improvement, regression, or stability compared to the last 3 entries. One sentence max, included in the Findings section.

## Output Format

Return exactly this template, filled in. No deviations.

```markdown
### {YYYY-MM-DD} | {Rating}

**Task:** {1-2 sentence summary}

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | {N} |
| Files read | {N} (re-reads: {N}) |
| Files written/edited | {N} |
| Tool calls | {N total} |
| Subagents | {N} |
| Rework cycles | {N} |

**Findings:**
{Bulleted list of observed waste patterns using the recommendation templates above. Include category name and severity in parentheses. If no findings: "None — session was efficient."}

**Recommendation:** {Single most impactful recommendation from findings. If Efficient: "No action needed."}

**Estimated savings:** {Rough per-session token estimate for the primary Recommendation, with a one-line derivation (e.g., "~2k tokens × 3 duplications = ~6k/session"), plus a projection over a 10–20 session horizon. Order-of-magnitude only — no false precision. If Efficient: "N/A — no recommendation."}

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
{2–4 bulleted ideas beyond the primary Recommendation, ranked highest-savings first. Each bullet: one-line lever + rough token estimate + one-line why it's bigger/smaller than the primary. Derive these by inspecting the session summary's "Largest files read" field and full file-read list (repeated reads), subagent count and output-handling pattern, and repeated tool operations — NOT by restating the Findings. If the session is Efficient (no primary Recommendation): "No additional levers — session was efficient." If the session has a primary Recommendation but no other material waste surfaced: "No additional levers — primary Recommendation captures the material waste."}
```

## Maintenance Routine

When the calling agent passes `MAINTENANCE: true` (triggered when the log has >25 session entries):

1. Identify the oldest 15 non-TREND entries (by date)
2. Produce a **Trend Summary** entry:

```markdown
### TREND — {start date} to {end date}

| Rating | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Efficient | {N} |
| Acceptable | {N} |
| Wasteful | {N} |

**Dominant pattern:** {most common waste category across the 15 entries}
**Trend direction:** {Improving / Stable / Worsening} — {1 sentence evidence}
**Top recommendation:** {the single recommendation that appeared most frequently}
```

3. Return two blocks:
   - The trend summary entry (to append at the end of the log — the tail — where the reader looks)
   - The full text of the 15 archived entries (the calling agent appends these to `logs/usage-log-archive.md`)

The calling agent then:
- Appends the trend summary at the end of the log (the tail — newest at the bottom, where `/prime`'s `tail -n 30` reader looks; the `### TREND` header is excluded from `check-usage-log-format.sh`'s dated-entry checks, so a tail-appended TREND entry does not trip the guard)
- Appends the 15 entries to `logs/usage-log-archive.md` (creates if needed, with header `# Usage Log — Archive`)
- Removes the 15 entries from the main log

## Failure Behavior

- **Missing session summary entirely:** Return an error message to the calling agent: "No session summary provided — cannot analyze." Do not produce a log entry.
- **Session summary missing required fields:** Fill affected metric rows with `not reported`. Do not infer or estimate. Proceed with analysis on available data.
- **Usage log contents not provided:** Treat as `NEW LOG` — skip trend comparison. Note "No prior entries for comparison" in Findings.
- **Session summary describes no substantive work (e.g., only a greeting or aborted session):** Return a minimal entry with "N/A" for all metrics and "Session too short for meaningful analysis" as the finding.
- **Maintenance triggered but fewer than 15 entries exist:** Skip maintenance. Return only the new session entry.

## Runtime Recommendations

- **Model:** No specific requirement — works with any Claude model. Designed for subagent invocation (lightweight context).
- **Context:** Receives session summary and log contents from the calling agent. Does not read files directly.
- **Invocation:** Subagent only — invoked by the `/usage-analysis` command. Not designed for interactive use.

## Known Limitations

- **Self-evaluation bias.** The calling agent builds its own session summary. It may undercount re-reads, miss context bloat, or underreport rework. This is inherent — only the session knows what happened. Treat findings as a lower bound, not a precise measurement.
- **Savings estimates are order-of-magnitude, not measured.** The Estimated savings and Additional levers figures are reasoned from file sizes, call counts, and duplication patterns in the session summary — they are not instrumented token measurements. Treat them as directional signal for prioritizing fixes, not as budget commitments.

## Guardrails

- Do not invent metrics absent from the session summary. Missing data → `not reported`.
- Do not soften findings. If waste occurred, name it plainly with the category and severity.
- Return exactly one primary Recommendation, plus the Estimated savings section and the Additional levers section. The primary stays the single most impactful action; the levers are ranked supporting ideas, not additional primary recommendations. Operators scan these logs — brevity within each section is still the priority.
- Do not comment on the quality of the session's output — only on token efficiency.
- Do not reference specific file contents or sensitive data in findings — refer to files by name only.

### Self-Check Before Returning

1. Does the entry match the output template exactly (all rows, all sections)?
2. Is the efficiency rating consistent with the finding severities?
3. Is there exactly one primary Recommendation, plus an Estimated savings section with derivation, plus an Additional levers section with 2–4 ranked items (or the Efficient-case fallbacks)?
4. If previous entries exist, did you include the trend comparison sentence?
5. Is the Estimated savings figure grounded in a concrete derivation (file sizes, call counts, duplication multipliers) rather than a bare number?
6. Are the Additional levers ranked by ROI (highest savings first), each with its own rough estimate?
