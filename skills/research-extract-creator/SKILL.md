  Produce structured Research Extracts from a component-organized research
  report and its corresponding Answer Specs — one extract per research question.
  Each extract contains a claims inventory with source attribution, evidence
  strength ratings, coverage verdicts per Answer Spec component, component
  syntheses, and gap/conflict documentation. Use when Patrik provides a research
  session output alongside Answer Specs and says "extract this," "create research
  extracts," "process this research output," "run extraction," or when a
  research report is provided with Answer Specs and the expectation of structured
  extracts. This is Step 2.3 of Stage 2 in the Axcion Research
  Workflow. Do NOT use for evidence verification against specs
  (evidence-spec-verifier), cluster-level analysis (cluster-analysis-pass),
  report prose writing (evidence-to-report-writer), or supplementary research
  decisions (operator's review at Step 2.4).

# Research Extract Creator

## Inputs

Both provided by the operator in a single message:

1. **Component-organized research report** — one session's output from the Research Executor, covering 2–4 research questions. Findings are organized under `Q[n]-A##` headers (question → answer spec component), with source citations carrying page title, URL, and access date. The report includes a **Source Log** (consolidated list of all sources cited), a **Known Gaps** section (components where the executor found insufficient evidence), and a **Conflicts** section (where sources disagree).
2. **Answer Specs** — for the specific questions covered in this session. Each spec lists required components and completion gates.

If either input is missing, ask for it before proceeding. If Answer Specs don't match the question/component headers in the report, flag the mismatch and ask for clarification.

## Output

One Research Extract per research question, written to a single markdown file. Use the template in `references/extract-template.md`.

Write output to the project's working directory using the naming convention: `research-extract-[session identifier].md` (e.g., `research-extract-A.md`). If no session identifier is provided, ask.

## Extraction Logic

### Claim Extraction

- Read the research report component by component (each `Q[n]-A##` section).
- Extract individual claims from the prose under each component header. Restate each claim in own words — do not copy verbatim from the report.
- Assign Claim IDs: `[Question ID]-C[sequential number]` (e.g., Q1-C01, Q1-C02).
- A single paragraph or table row may yield multiple claims if it contains distinct factual assertions.
- Primary component mapping is given by the report structure — a claim extracted from a `Q[n]-A##` section belongs to that component. When a finding under one component is also relevant to another, cross-reference it in the secondary component.

### Source Attribution

- Carry over source citations (page title, URL, access date) exactly as cited in the research report. Cross-check against the report's Source Log for completeness.
- Do not verify, modify, or enrich source citations — take them at face value.
- Record the source locator: component header (`Q[n]-A##`) and position within it (paragraph number, table label, bullet position) in the research report.

### Evidence Strength (per claim)

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| **H** | Multiple independent credible sources; primary or institutional data; direct evidence from a primary or institutional source |
| **M** | Single credible source, or multiple sources with shared editorial origin; indirect but reasonable evidence |
| **L** | Single source of uncertain quality; inferential; tangential relevance; vendor/advocacy source without corroboration |

### Independence Counting

- Count editorially independent sources supporting each claim.
- Syndicated content, derivative reports citing the same primary data, and secondary sources restating the same original finding count as one.
- If independence is unclear, note the uncertainty rather than guessing.

### Coverage Verdicts (per Answer Spec component)

| Verdict | Threshold |
|---------|-----------|
| **COVERED** | ≥2 claims with ≥1 at H strength, OR ≥3 claims at M strength with ≥2 independent sources across them |
| **THIN** | 1 claim at any strength, OR 2+ claims but all L strength, OR only sources with shared editorial origin |
| **MISSING** | No claims extracted for this component |

### Component Synthesis

Per component, write 2–3 sentences summarizing what the evidence collectively shows. State what is established (H-grade claims), what is suggested (M), and what remains uncertain (L or gaps). This is analytical framing — what the evidence means, not a claim recap. The synthesis must be derivable from the claims listed below it. Do not introduce framing the claims don't support.

### Gaps

Start from the report's Known Gaps section — these are components the executor flagged as insufficiently evidenced. Ingest each, then apply the extract-creator's own coverage verdicts to confirm or reclassify. Final gap classification:

- **Not addressed** — component absent from the report entirely
- **Searched but not found** — report's Known Gaps flags scarcity, confirmed by extract coverage
- **Found but weak** — evidence exists but below COVERED threshold (may or may not appear in Known Gaps)

Note whether the gap matters for downstream narrative.

### Conflicts

Start from the report's Conflicts section — these are disagreements the executor documented. Ingest each, then assess which position has stronger support based on source credibility and independence, and recommend handling (resolve, present both, flag as open). If additional conflicts emerge during claim extraction that the report did not flag, document those as well.

## Failure Behavior

- **Component not covered in report** → mark MISSING in Coverage Verdicts. Component Synthesis: "No evidence found in the research report for this component." Do not synthesize from training data or infer from adjacent evidence.
- **Evidence is thin** → extract claims that exist, mark THIN, write Component Synthesis reflecting the limited evidence. Do not complete the component with plausible-sounding filler.
- **Ambiguous source citation** (URL missing, source name unclear) → carry through with a caveat in Notes: "[Source citation unclear in original report]". Cross-check the report's Source Log. Do not fabricate source metadata.
- **Contradictory claims** → capture both as separate claims in the Claims Inventory and document in the Conflicts section. Do not silently resolve by picking one.

If the provided information is insufficient to extract confidently, say so rather than inferring. Leave gaps rather than invent plausible-sounding details.

## Scope Boundaries

This skill extracts and structures — it does not verify sources, supplement evidence from training data, make editorial judgments about report inclusion, or compress/summarize content.

## Output Protocol

No refinement mode. Produce all Research Extracts for the session in a single file. The operator reviews extracts at Step 2.4 and requests re-extraction if needed.
