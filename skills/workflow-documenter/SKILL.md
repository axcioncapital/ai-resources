# Workflow Documenter

## Scope

- Converting rough process ideas into formal workflow structure
- Applying consistent formatting conventions
- Clarifying implicit logic (conditionals, loops, dependencies)

Input must provide the process — this skill structures and polishes, not designs from scratch.

## Output Structure

Every workflow document follows this structure:

```
# [Workflow Name]

**Input:** [What the workflow receives]
**Output:** [What the workflow produces]

## Stage 1: [Stage Name]

### 1.1 [Step Title] [Tool]
[1-3 sentences: action → method → destination]

**Output:** [What this step produces]

### 1.2 [Step Title]
...

## Stage 2: [Stage Name]
...
```

## Formatting Conventions

### Stages and Steps

- Stages are major phases (numbered 1, 2, 3...)
- Steps are actions within stages (numbered 1.1, 1.2, 2.1...)
- Stage names: descriptive nouns or noun phrases
- Step titles: action-oriented (start with verb)

### Tool Context Tags

Add tool/platform context in brackets after step titles when workflows span multiple tools:

- `### 1.1 Fill Template [Google Docs]`
- `### 1.2 Refine Draft [Claude]`
- `### 2.1 Execute Research [GPT-5]`

Use tool tags when the workflow uses 2+ platforms or when the step requires a context switch. Omit when the entire workflow happens in one tool or the tool is obvious.

### Step Content

Each step contains:
1. Core action (what happens)
2. Method or tool behavior (how it works)
3. Output destination (where it goes)

Plus an **Output:** line specifying what the step produces.

If a step needs more than 3 sentences, split it into multiple steps.

### Conditionals and Loops

Use blockquotes for conditions, loops, and routing logic:

```markdown
> **Condition:** If the draft fails QC, return to Step 2.1.

> **Loop:** Repeat Steps 3.1-3.3 for each section until all sections pass review.

> **Note:** Skip this step if no external data sources are required.
```

Make routing explicit: "If X → return to Step Y", "Exit loop when Z", "If A, proceed to Stage 3; otherwise continue to Step 2.4".

### QC vs Remediation

- QC steps identify problems (do not fix)
- Remediation steps fix problems (separate from QC)

### Tables

Use tables for checklists, structured reference information, and criteria lists. Keep cell content short and headers clear.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse Input

Identify from the rough input:
- Major phases (become Stages)
- Actions within each phase (become Steps)
- Conditional logic or loops
- Input and output of the overall workflow

### Step 2: Structure

Organize into the standard format:
- Create Input/Output declarations
- Number stages sequentially
- Number steps hierarchically (1.1, 1.2, 2.1...)
- Name each stage and step clearly

### Step 3: Write Step Content

For each step:
- Write 1-3 sentences following: action → method → destination
- Specify the output
- Add tool tag if workflow spans multiple tools

### Step 4: Add Control Flow

Insert blockquotes for:
- Conditions that affect routing
- Loops and their exit criteria
- Notes about when steps apply or don't apply

### Step 5: Produce Output

Deliver the complete workflow documentation as markdown.

## Writing Standards

**Tone:** Imperative, action-oriented.
- "Transform the..." not "The user transforms the..."
- "Review the..." not "This step involves reviewing..."

**Sentence length:** Under 25 words where possible. What to do, not why.
