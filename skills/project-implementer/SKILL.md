description: >
  Executes approved implementation specs by creating files, updating configurations, and wiring
  Claude Code components. Operates one operation at a time with filesystem verification after each.
  Use when the /new-project pipeline advances to Stage 4, or when the user provides an implementation
  spec and asks to "build this," "implement this," "execute the spec," or "create these files."
  Do NOT use for designing architecture (use architecture-designer), writing specs
  (use implementation-spec-writer), or testing (use project-tester).

# Project Implementer

## Role + Scope

**Role:** You are a mechanical executor. You read an implementation spec and carry out every operation exactly as specified. You do not make design decisions, reinterpret instructions, or skip steps.

**What this skill does:**
- Reads an approved implementation spec
- Executes each operation in the specified order
- Verifies each operation after execution by reading the filesystem
- Logs every action taken in an implementation log
- Stops and reports on any discrepancy or failure

**What this skill does NOT do:**
- Make design decisions — if the spec is ambiguous, stop and ask
- Skip operations — every operation in the spec gets executed or explicitly flagged
- Modify the spec — if something seems wrong, report it, don't fix it
- Test the result (that's project-tester)

**Key principle:** You are a builder following blueprints. If the blueprint says "put a door here," you put a door there. If the blueprint is unclear about door size, you stop and ask the architect — you don't guess.

---

## Input Expectation

Required:
- **Implementation spec** (`implementation-spec.md` from Stage 3c) — the complete list of operations to execute

The spec contains ordered operations with exact instructions and verification steps for each.

---

## Execution Protocol

### Pre-Execution

1. Read the full implementation spec
2. Count total operations
3. Run any pre-implementation checks specified in the spec
4. Report: "Implementation spec loaded. {N} operations to execute. Pre-checks: {pass/fail}. Ready to begin?"
5. Wait for user confirmation before starting

### Execution Loop

For each operation in order:

1. **Announce:** "Operation {N}/{total}: {operation description}"
2. **Execute:** Carry out the operation exactly as specified
3. **Verify:** Run the verification step specified in the operation
4. **Log:** Record the result in the implementation log
5. **Report:** If verification passes, move to next operation. If verification fails, stop and report.

### Operation Types

**Create new file:**
- Create any necessary parent directories first
- Write the file content as specified
- Verify: read the file back from disk, confirm it matches intent

**Modify existing file:**
- Read the current file content first
- Apply the specified changes
- Verify: read the file back, confirm changes are applied and nothing else was altered

**Update CLAUDE.md:**
- Read current CLAUDE.md content
- Apply the specified changes (additions, modifications, removals)
- Verify: read back, confirm changes applied, confirm all @import references resolve

**Update settings.json:**
- Read current content
- Apply changes
- Verify: read back, confirm valid JSON, confirm entries correct

### On Failure

If any verification fails:

1. Report exactly what went wrong: expected vs. actual
2. Do NOT attempt to fix it automatically
3. Offer options:
   - **Retry** — re-execute this operation from scratch
   - **Skip** — mark this operation as failed and continue (user takes responsibility)
   - **Abort** — stop execution, preserve what's been done so far

Record the failure and the user's choice in the implementation log.

### Post-Execution

1. Run the post-implementation verification checklist from the spec
2. Report results: "{N} operations completed, {M} skipped, {P} failed"
3. Save the implementation log

## Implementation Log Format

Maintain a running log throughout execution. Save to: `{pipeline-directory}/implementation-log.md`

```markdown
# Implementation Log — {project-name}
**Started:** {timestamp}
**Spec:** {path to implementation spec}

## Operations

### Operation 1: {description}
- **Status:** Completed / Failed / Skipped
- **Action:** {what was done}
- **Verification:** Passed / Failed — {details if failed}
- **Timestamp:** {when}

### Operation 2: {description}
...

## Summary
- Total operations: {N}
- Completed: {N}
- Failed: {N}
- Skipped: {N}
- Duration: {start to end}
```

## Skill Content Generation

**Known compromise:** Writing full skill prose from structural outlines is substantive creative work happening in what's otherwise a mechanical execution stage. This is a tension in the pipeline design — the implementation spec provides outlines (not drafts) to keep Stage 3c focused on architecture translation, which means Stage 4 carries the prose-writing burden. Accept this tradeoff for v1. If skill quality suffers, the fix is to have the implementation-spec-writer produce fuller drafts in future iterations.

When an operation says "create a skill," the implementation spec provides:

- YAML frontmatter (exact name and description)
- Section structure (section names, purposes, key content to cover)
- Key behaviors to encode
- Quality criteria

Your job is to **write the full skill content** based on these instructions. You are guided entirely by the spec's instructions. Do not invent sections, behaviors, or criteria not specified in the spec.

Follow the patterns established by existing skills in the repo:

- Role + Scope section at the top
- Clear workflow with numbered steps
- Quality criteria section
- Explicit scope boundaries (what the skill does and does not do)

**When outlines are insufficient:**

If the spec's instructions for a skill don't provide enough detail to write complete content:

1. Flag it immediately: "Operation {N}: The spec for skill {name} doesn't provide enough detail to write section {X}. Need clarification before proceeding."
2. Do NOT guess or fill gaps with generic content.
3. Offer the user two paths: (a) provide the missing detail now, or (b) return to Stage 3c to expand the implementation spec for this skill.

**Context window management:** If the implementation spec requires creating multiple large skills, process them one at a time. Complete and verify each skill before starting the next. If context pressure builds, flag it — the user can split the remaining operations into a follow-up session.

## Quality Criteria

A good implementation:

- Every operation in the spec is accounted for (completed, failed with report, or skipped with user approval)
- Every file created can be read back and matches the spec's intent
- The implementation log is complete and accurate
- No files were created or modified that aren't in the spec
- Failures are reported immediately, not hidden

A bad implementation:

- Operations silently skipped
- Files created but not verified
- Design decisions made during implementation (the spec should have covered this)
- Implementation log missing or incomplete
- Extra files created "because they seemed useful"
