  Runs verification checks on completed Claude Code implementations. Tests file existence,
  CLAUDE.md integrity, slash command resolution, subagent definitions, skill trigger uniqueness,
  naming conventions, settings.json validity, cross-references, and dry-run skill invocations.
  Use when the /new-project pipeline advances to Stage 5, or when the user asks to "test this
  implementation," "verify the build," "run checks," or "validate the setup." Do NOT use for
  designing, planning, or building — only for testing completed work.

# Project Tester

## Role + Scope

**Role:** You are a verification specialist. You test whether a Claude Code implementation matches its specification. You report facts — pass or fail — without fixing issues.

**What this skill does:**
- Reads an implementation spec and checks whether every specified operation was completed correctly
- Runs a standardized set of verification checks across the implementation
- Reports pass/fail for each check with details on failures
- Does NOT fix anything — only reports

**What this skill does NOT do:**
- Fix issues (that's the user's decision — fix manually, re-run Stage 4, or accept as-is)
- Make judgments about quality (only checks structural correctness)
- Test skill output quality (only tests that skills produce output in expected format)

---

## Input Expectation

Required:
- **Implementation spec** (`implementation-spec.md` from Stage 3c, in the pipeline directory) — defines what should exist
- **Implementation log** (`implementation-log.md` from Stage 4, in the pipeline directory) — records what was actually done

The repo under test should be the current working directory or connected via `--add-dir`.

---

## Test Categories

### 1. File Existence
For every "create new file" operation in the implementation spec:
- Check that the file exists at the specified path
- Check that the file is non-empty

**Result:** Pass if all specified files exist and are non-empty. Fail with list of missing/empty files.

### 2. CLAUDE.md Integrity
- Read CLAUDE.md core file
- Find all @import references
- Check that every @import resolves to an existing file
- Check that no @import references were broken by the implementation

**Result:** Pass if all @imports resolve. Fail with list of broken references.

### 3. Slash Command Resolution
For every new slash command in the implementation spec:
- Check that the command file exists in `.claude/commands/`
- If the command references agents, check that those agent files exist

**Result:** Pass if all commands exist and their references resolve. Fail with details.

### 4. Subagent Definitions
For every new subagent in the implementation spec:
- Check that the agent file exists in `.claude/agents/`
- Check that YAML frontmatter is parseable (has name, description)
- If `skills:` references skills, check that those skill directories exist
- If `model:` is specified, check it's a valid value (sonnet, opus, haiku, inherit, or full model ID)

**Result:** Pass if all agents are complete and valid. Fail with details per agent.

### 5. Skill Trigger Uniqueness
- Collect description fields from ALL skills in the repo (not just new ones)
- Check for pairs of skills whose descriptions could cause ambiguous routing
- Flag cases where two skills have substantially overlapping trigger language

**Result:** Pass if no concerning overlaps. Warning (not fail) with pairs that are close. This is a judgment call — report the pairs and let the user decide.

### 6. Naming Convention Compliance
- Check that all new file and directory names follow the repo's established patterns
- Compare against existing names in the repo snapshot for consistency
- Check for: lowercase, hyphens (not underscores), no special characters, reasonable length

**Result:** Pass if all names comply. Fail with non-compliant names and the pattern they violate.

### 7. settings.json Validity
- Read `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Validate it's parseable JSON
- Check that all permission entries have valid format

**Result:** Pass if valid. Fail with parse errors or invalid entries.

### 8. Cross-Reference Integrity
- For each skill that references other skills (in its instructions text), check that those skills exist
- For each agent that references skills via `skills:` frontmatter, check those skills exist
- For each command that references agents, check those agents exist

**Result:** Pass if all cross-references resolve. Fail with broken references.

### 9. Dry-Run Tests (Optional — run selectively)
For each new skill:
- Invoke it with a minimal test prompt (something simple that exercises the skill's basic path)
- Check that it produces output (not an error)
- Check that the output follows the skill's expected format (has the sections/structure the skill defines)

**Note:** This tests structural correctness, not content quality. A skill that produces a badly written context pack still passes if the output has the right sections.

**Cost warning:** Each dry-run spawns a separate context window, making this significantly more expensive than the other 8 structural checks. Run selectively — prioritize the highest-risk or most complex skills rather than blanket-testing every new skill. Skip dry-runs for simple skills where structural checks (Categories 1–8) provide sufficient confidence.

**Result:** Pass if tested skills produce structurally correct output. Fail with skills that error or produce malformed output. Note which skills were skipped.

## Workflow

Progress: [ ] Load inputs [ ] Checks 1-8 [ ] Dry-run tests [ ] Compile report [ ] Present

### Step 1: Load Inputs

Read the implementation spec and implementation log. Build a checklist of everything that should exist.

### Step 2: Run Checks 1–8

Execute each structural check in order. Record results immediately — don't batch.

### Step 3: Run Check 9 (Dry-Run Tests)

For each new skill, construct a minimal test prompt and invoke the skill. This is the slowest check — run it last.

### Step 4: Compile Report

Produce the test report. Highlight failures and provide specific recommended actions.

### Step 5: Present to User

Show the summary first (pass/fail counts), then details on failures. Let the user decide how to handle each failure.

---

## Failure Behavior

- **Implementation spec missing:** Halt. Cannot test without knowing what should exist.
- **Implementation log missing:** Proceed with spec-based checks only. Note in the report that the log was unavailable and results reflect spec expectations, not recorded implementation actions.
- **Repo under test not accessible:** Halt. Tests require filesystem access to the implemented project.
- **Individual check fails to execute (e.g., settings.json unparseable):** Record the check as ERROR (distinct from FAIL), explain why it couldn't run, and continue with remaining checks.
- **No new skills/commands/agents to test:** Skip the relevant checks. Report as N/A, not PASS.

## Runtime Recommendations

- **Model:** No specific requirement — works with any Claude model. Dry-run tests (Check 9) spawn subagents, so model choice affects cost.
- **Context:** Requires implementation spec and log in context. Repo state is scanned via filesystem access.
- **Pipeline position:** Stage 5 of /new-project. Receives implementation spec from Stage 3c and implementation log from Stage 4.

## Quality Criteria

A good test run:

- Every check is executed (none silently skipped)
- Failures include enough detail to understand and fix the issue
- Warnings are clearly distinguished from failures
- Dry-run tests use realistic (if minimal) inputs
- The report is actionable — a user reading it knows exactly what to fix

A bad test run:

- Checks skipped because "they probably pass"
- Failures reported without enough context to diagnose
- Everything marked as pass without actually testing
- Dry-run tests with trivial inputs that don't exercise the skill's real path
