description: >
  Merges QC-approved supplementary Perplexity research results into existing
  Research Extracts. Adds new claims with [SUPPLEMENTARY] tags, recalculates
  coverage verdicts, updates component syntheses, and maintains gap/conflict
  sections. Produces updated extracts that replace originals.

  Step 2.S4 in Stage 2 Subworkflow 2.S. Use when supplementary research QC
  (Step 2.S3) has produced MERGE/PARTIAL verdicts confirmed by the operator.
  Triggered by "merge supplementary evidence," "run step 2.S4," "update extracts
  with supplementary results," or similar.

  Do NOT use for initial extract creation (that's research-extract-creator at
  Step 2.3). Do NOT use for QC of supplementary results (that's
  supplementary-research-qc at Step 2.S3). Do NOT use for drafting queries
  (that's supplementary-query-brief-drafter at Step 2.S1).

# Supplementary Evidence Merger

Integrate QC-approved supplementary research results into existing Research Extracts. The updated extract is a complete, self-contained artifact that replaces the previous version — indistinguishable in structure from a single-pass extract, with `[SUPPLEMENTARY]` tags as the only markers of supplementary origin.

**Workflow position:** Step 2.S4 in Subworkflow 2.S. Receives MERGE/PARTIAL verdicts from Step 2.S3. Produces updated Research Extracts that replace originals in `/execution/research-extracts/`.

## Calibration

Do not overstate what supplementary evidence adds. If it moved a component from THIN to COVERED on the strength of two Medium sources, the synthesis should reflect moderate confidence, not strong confidence. Supplementary evidence fills gaps — it doesn't transform weak evidence bases into strong ones unless the evidence genuinely warrants it.

## Input

Three items, provided together:

1. **Research Extracts** — current versions for all affected questions
2. **QC-approved supplementary results** — the MERGE items from Step 2.S3 verdicts, with specific claims identified for merging
3. **Answer Specs** — for the affected questions (needed for coverage verdict recalculation)

### Input Validation

Before proceeding:
- If fewer than three input items are provided, state which are missing and request them
- Verify MERGE items reference valid query numbers from the QC report
- For PARTIAL items, verify the specific claims approved for merging are identified
- If mismatched: state the mismatch, request correction, do not proceed

## Claim ID Invariant

Every discrete factual assertion entering the extract through this skill MUST receive its own Claim ID. No exceptions for how findings are structured in the source material.

When a QC-approved item contains multiple distinct assertions bundled in a single finding block (e.g., "transaction costs run 2–4%, sourcing costs consume 15–30% of fees, IRR drag is ~1pp"), decompose it into individual claims before merging. Each quantitative figure, each named-source finding, and each independently citable statement is a separate claim. If a finding block contains N distinct assertions, it produces N claims with N Claim IDs.

**Test:** If a downstream writer could cite this assertion independently in report prose, it needs its own Claim ID.

## Merge Process

### Step 1: Add Supplementary Claims

For each MERGE item from the QC results:

- **Decompose first.** If a MERGE item contains multiple discrete assertions, split it into individual claims before proceeding. Do not merge block-level findings as a single claim.
- Create new claims under the appropriate Answer Spec component in the Research Extract.
- Assign Claim IDs that continue the existing sequence for that question (e.g., if the last existing claim is Q3-C08, new supplementary claims start at Q3-C09).
- For each new claim:
  - Write the claim statement in your own words (do not copy verbatim from Perplexity output)
  - **Sources:** carry over source name(s) and URL(s) from the Perplexity results
  - **Source locator:** "Supplementary research, Pass [1/2], Query [#]"
  - **Strength:** assign H/M/L per the standard rubric
  - **Independence:** count independent sources, including assessment of independence from sources already in the extract
  - **Notes:** include `[SUPPLEMENTARY]` tag. Add linkage type and caveats as normal.

For PARTIAL items from QC: merge only the specific claims approved. Skip the claims marked for exclusion.

### Step 2: Recalculate Coverage Verdicts

For each component that received new claims, recalculate the coverage verdict using the threshold rubric applied to the full claim set (original + supplementary):

- **COVERED:** >=2 claims with >=1 at High strength, OR >=3 claims at Medium strength with >=2 independent sources
- **THIN:** 1 claim at any strength, OR 2+ claims but all Low, OR only sources with shared editorial origin
- **MISSING:** No claims for this component

Update the Coverage Verdicts table. In the Notes column, indicate what changed: e.g., "THIN -> COVERED after supplementary pass 1 (added 2 Medium-strength claims from independent Nordic sources)."

### Step 3: Update Component Syntheses

For each component that received new claims, rewrite the Component Synthesis paragraph to reflect the combined evidence. The updated synthesis must:

- Integrate supplementary findings naturally — do not write a separate "supplementary findings" paragraph
- Accurately reflect the updated strength distribution across all claims (original + supplementary)
- Not overstate what the supplementary evidence adds

### Step 4: Update Gaps and Conflicts

- **Gaps:** remove or downgrade any gaps that were closed by supplementary evidence. If a gap moved from MISSING to THIN, update the gap entry to reflect remaining weakness rather than total absence.
- **Conflicts:** if supplementary evidence introduces a new source that conflicts with existing claims, add it to the Conflicts section with the standard format (both positions, relative support, recommended handling).

### Step 5: Update Extraction Metadata

Set `Supplementary research: Yes` and list which components were supplemented and in which pass.

## Output Format

Updated Research Extracts — one per affected question. Each is a complete, self-contained artifact that replaces the previous version. The only markers of supplementary evidence are:
- `[SUPPLEMENTARY]` tags on individual claims
- The metadata field noting supplementary research was performed

### Step 6: Check Downstream Propagation

After updating extracts, check whether any downstream artifact already references the affected components. This prevents stale data from persisting in artifacts written before the merge.

- **Cluster memos** (`/analysis/cluster-memos/`): if any exist for the affected section, check whether they reference the component's prior coverage verdict or cite claims from the component. If so, list them as needing update.
- **Section directives** (`/analysis/section-directives/`): if any exist and incorporated scarcity handling for a component whose gap is now closed, list them as needing revision.
- **Chapter drafts and report prose** (`/analysis/chapters/`, `/report/chapters/`): if any exist, flag the affected passages. These are subject to the bright-line rule before modification.

If no downstream artifacts exist yet (the typical case at Step 2.S4), note "No downstream artifacts to update" and skip.

Include the propagation check results in the output summary under **Downstream Impact**. For each artifact that needs updating, list: file path, what changed (verdict upgrade, scarcity resolution, new claims), and which step should perform the update.

## Output Protocol

Write updated extracts to `/execution/research-extracts/`, replacing the originals. Provide a brief summary in chat: per question, which components changed verdict, claim count before/after, any remaining THIN/MISSING components, and any downstream artifacts flagged for update.

## Scope Boundaries

- Do not QC supplementary results — that's upstream (Step 2.S3)
- Do not draft queries or execute research — that's Steps 2.S1–2.S2
- Do not supplement evidence from training data or external knowledge
- Do not make editorial judgments about finding importance — integrate what QC approved
- Do not modify claims from the original extract — only add new supplementary claims and update syntheses/verdicts to reflect the combined evidence
