# Execution Manifest Creator

## Purpose

Route research questions to the right execution tool, group Research GPT questions into sessions, and produce a manifest the operator follows during execution. This preserves cross-model separation: GPT handles all evidence gathering (both paths), Claude handles synthesis, extraction, and QC.

## Input Requirements

**Required:**
1. **Answer Specs** — per-question specifications for all questions in the current research section
2. **Research Plan** — scope, source landscape context, key terms for the current section

Both provided by the operator. Do not generate these.

**If inputs are incomplete:** Flag missing elements. Halt for critical gaps (missing Answer Specs, missing scope parameters). Proceed with best-effort routing for non-critical gaps (e.g., missing source preferences) and flag assumptions.

## Routing Criteria

Evaluate each question against these criteria to determine routing.

### Route to Research GPT when:

- **Source scarcity** — the topic has sparse, niche, or hard-to-find sources (e.g., Nordic mid-market PE practices, practitioner behavioral patterns, unpublished industry data). Research GPT's autonomous browsing across 30+ sources is needed to surface what exists.
- **Source breadth required** — the answer requires synthesizing many sources of different types (academic, practitioner, industry reports, vendor publications). A single search session won't cover it.
- **Exploratory scope** — the question is open-ended enough that the researcher doesn't know in advance which sources will be valuable. Research GPT's ability to pivot during execution is the advantage.
- **Cross-referencing needed** — the answer requires comparing claims across multiple source types to assess reliability (e.g., validating a specific data claim against original sources).

### Route to CustomGPT when:

- **Well-sourced topics** — abundant, accessible, high-quality sources exist (published frameworks, standard industry practices, established academic research). Standard web browsing surfaces the key sources efficiently.
- **Definitional or structural questions** — the answer is primarily about defining concepts, mapping structures, or describing established processes where a few authoritative sources suffice.
- **Known source landscape** — the Answer Spec or Research Plan identifies specific source types or publications likely to contain the answer. Targeted browsing is sufficient.
- **Synthesis over discovery** — the question primarily needs analytical synthesis of known material rather than discovery of unknown sources.
- **Low independence requirement** — the Answer Spec doesn't require high source independence counts — a few credible sources are sufficient for a COVERED verdict.

### Tie-breaking rules:

1. When a question could go either way, route to CustomGPT. Preserve Research GPT sessions for questions that genuinely need browsing depth.
2. If a question is borderline between Research GPT and CustomGPT, route to CustomGPT. Preserve Research GPT sessions for questions that genuinely need browsing depth.
3. Questions with MISSING-risk components (anticipated thin results) should stay on Research GPT — supplementary research is more expensive than getting depth on the first pass.

### Tool selection — Research GPT vs Perplexity:

- **Research GPT (default):** Better for broad exploratory research, longer reports, more source depth. Use unless a Perplexity-specific condition applies.
- **Perplexity:** Better when the source landscape is known and targeted, when Nordic/Scandinavian source bias is valuable, or when the question benefits from Perplexity's citation style.
- **Tie-breaker:** When conditions point in different directions, prefer Research GPT. Consider assigning Perplexity to a later session to diversify source coverage across the section.

## Session Grouping Logic (Research GPT only)

After routing, group Research GPT questions into sessions:

1. **Respect dependencies first:** Map all dependencies before grouping. Dependencies are hard constraints that override clustering preferences.
2. **Target 2 questions per session.** Sessions of 1 or 3 are acceptable when dependency constraints or strong source overlap justify it. Avoid sessions larger than 3 — smaller sessions produce deeper coverage.
3. **Optimize by source overlap** (strongest signal), then conceptual chain, then analytical lens.

### Dependency Classification

Classify every inter-question relationship before grouping. Each pair of questions with a relationship gets exactly one classification:

- **Hard dependency:** Question B requires Question A's output as input (e.g., B synthesizes A's findings, B's scope is defined by A's results). **Handling:** Place in sequential sessions. The manifest's dependency column must show the upstream session. The downstream session cannot execute until the upstream session's extracts are available.
- **Soft dependency:** Questions A and B analyze overlapping phenomena from different angles — consistency matters but neither requires the other's output. (e.g., both address capacity constraints, one maps the bottleneck while the other maps the role structure that creates it). **Handling:** Either (a) sequence the sessions and note that the later session benefits from the earlier session's context, or (b) embed shared analytical assumptions from the Research Plan into both prompts so they work from the same baseline. The manifest's dependency column must show "Soft: [brief description]" — never "None."
- **None:** No analytical relationship. Questions address unrelated phenomena with no overlap in scope, actors, or mechanisms.

**Classification test:** If a steering note would reference another session's findings (e.g., "should be consistent with Session A's coverage gap findings"), that is at minimum a soft dependency. If the reference would say "requires" or "depends on," it is a hard dependency. Do not classify a relationship as "None" and then add a cross-session flag in the prompt — that is a contradiction.

## Country-Specific Language-Block Routing (S-04)

When a research question targets country-specific evidence (Sweden, Norway, or Finland individually — not a Nordic-wide aggregate question), the manifest must route a dedicated local-language search block alongside the English-language pass. The block can land as either (a) a sub-block within the same Research GPT session as the English pass, or (b) a dedicated session for the local-language pass when the country's evidence load is large enough to warrant separation.

**Language-block assignments:**

| Country in question | Required local-language pass |
|---|---|
| Sweden-specific | Swedish |
| Norway-specific | Norwegian |
| Finland-specific | Finnish |
| Two-country (e.g., Sweden + Finland) | Both relevant languages, separate blocks |
| Three-country (Sweden + Norway + Finland) | All three languages, separate blocks |
| Pan-Nordic aggregate (no country breakdown required) | English-only is acceptable |

**Block-or-session decision rule.** If the country-specific question is paired with an English pass that already targets ≥3 directives, route the local-language pass as a separate session to preserve session-depth budgets (per the 2-questions-per-session target rule above). If the English pass is single-directive or two-directive, the local-language pass lands as a sub-block within the same session.

**Manifest column.** The manifest must include a `Language passes` column for every Research GPT session, listing which language passes (English + which local languages) the session contains. CustomGPT-routed questions do not require this column (CustomGPT lacks the search-language steerability for native-language passes).

**Rationale.** Stage 2 English-only searches over-represent large-cap deals because the international press picks up large transactions; native-language press picks up lower-mid-market deals that don't reach the English wires. The dedicated local-language block is the primary remediation for the "Norway / Finland evidence thin because English-only" failure mode that R1 exposed. This is a Bundle 2b enforcement coupled to `research-prompt-creator`'s native-language search-term blocks.

## CustomGPT Batching Logic

Group CustomGPT questions into batches of 2–3 questions per run:

1. Group by source overlap where possible (questions likely answered by the same literature).
2. No hard session cap — CustomGPT runs are independent of Research GPT sessions.
3. Recommend starting a new chat after 2–3 batches to prevent context degradation.

## Dependency: Research CustomGPT

The CustomGPT execution path requires a Research CustomGPT with web access. This is a lighter research tool that handles well-sourced, lower-complexity questions without the full research execution workflow. Research extraction and QC are handled downstream by `research-extract-creator`.

## Failure Behavior

- **All questions route to Research GPT** — that's fine. Produce a manifest with no CustomGPT queue. Verify session groupings follow the 2-question target.
- **All questions route to CustomGPT** — that's fine. Produce a manifest with no Research GPT sessions. The `research-prompt-creator` step is skipped entirely.
- **Routing rationale genuinely unclear** — route to CustomGPT with a note: "Borderline — rerouted to CustomGPT. Consider Research GPT if CustomGPT results are thin."
- **Answer Specs ambiguous about source requirements** — flag the ambiguity in the routing rationale, make a best-effort decision, and note the uncertainty.

## Accuracy Over Completeness

If the provided inputs are insufficient to route confidently, say so rather than inferring. It is acceptable to flag uncertainty in routing rationale rather than invent confident-sounding justifications. If the Answer Specs contain questionable assumptions about source availability, flag them constructively.

## Output Protocol

Produce the full Execution Manifest in a single pass using the template in `references/manifest-template.md`. No refinement mode — the operator reviews the manifest and can override individual routing decisions before execution begins.

The manifest's session groupings are authoritative for downstream steps. When the operator passes this manifest to `research-prompt-creator`, that skill accepts the session groupings as given input and writes prompts accordingly.

**Operator overrides:** If the operator overrides a routing decision, update the manifest accordingly — adjust session groupings and the routing summary table to reflect the change, then re-run the self-check. Do not regenerate from scratch unless the override changes the majority of routing decisions.

Deliver as markdown.

## Self-Check

Before delivering, verify:

- Every research question appears in exactly one route (Research GPT or CustomGPT)
- Research GPT sessions target 2 questions each (1 or 3 acceptable with justification)
- All dependencies between questions are reflected in session ordering — every inter-question relationship is classified as Hard, Soft, or None
- No session's dependency column shows "None" while its steering notes or downstream prompts would reference another session's findings
- Parallel execution opportunities are explicitly identified
- Routing rationale is specific to each question (not generic)
- The routing summary table matches the detailed session/queue sections
- CustomGPT batches are 2–3 questions each
- Every Research GPT session has a `Language passes` column populated (English + local languages as applicable per country-specific question routing per § Country-Specific Language-Block Routing); pan-Nordic aggregate sessions may list English only (S-04)
