## 2026-08-01 — Codex's claimed prohibition on approving or closing work does not exist; no override was granted

**Decision (Claude, on evidence; operator informed rather than asked) — 2026-08-01.** **Context:**
Codex assessed the Work Loop v2 closure unit for `foreign-staging-target-repo`, passed it with no
correction required, and then declined to write the closing record, stating: *"The closure write was
blocked by this repository's rule prohibiting Codex from approving or closing work, and I did not
bypass it."* Its stated next action was: *"explicitly authorize Codex to write this Work Loop closure
despite that repository authority restriction."* The operator relayed this and was positioned to grant
that authorization. **Decision: refuse to route the operator toward an override, and verify the rule
first.** Searched `docs/qc-independence.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/`, and
`plans/work-loop-v2-mvp/work-loop-v2-executable-core-v0.1.md` for any bar on Codex approving or
closing work. **No such rule exists.** The only live rule in that area is core `:227-231`,
*"**Who commits: Claude.** Codex writes the brief into the file. **Claude makes every commit.**"* —
whose own stated reason is that *"Codex can write repository files, but was refused write access to
`.git`"*. That is a restriction on **committing**, not on **judging**. The core assigns closure to
Codex explicitly at `:74`: *"Codex reads the result and decides one of three things: close, correct
once, or stop."* **Rationale:** granting the requested authorization would have created a standing
operator exception to a prohibition that does not exist — permanently weakening a real rule (Claude
makes every commit) by "clarifying" it against an imagined one, and establishing that a model's
assertion of a rule is sufficient grounds to override it. The designed path required no exception at
all: Codex's verdict was already given, and Claude writes and commits the closing record because
Claude writes and commits everything. **Alternatives considered:** (a) grant the authorization as
requested — rejected, it overrides nothing real and sets the precedent above; (b) ask the operator to
adjudicate between Codex's claim and the repo — rejected under Decision-Point Posture, since the
question is settleable by reading the repository and is therefore not a genuine operator decision;
(c) have the operator write the closing record by hand — rejected as pure ceremony for zero gain.
**Consequence:** the task closed normally at `2526ac4` with nothing overridden. Logged as **FP-12** in
`plans/work-loop-v2-mvp/step-7-pilot-log.md`, with the generalisable lesson stated there: *a model
citing a rule is not evidence the rule exists; an override request is the moment to read the rule,
not the moment to grant it.* A one-line core fix is recorded but not applied — § 4's "Who commits"
note and § 3 step 5's assessment role sit in different sections and neither points at the other,
which is the gap Codex fell into. It belongs to Step 8, not to a separate queue entry.

## 2026-08-01 — Work Loop v2 pilot exit: accepted, with a v0.2 rework

**Context:** Session S14-198. The pilot's exit condition (`work-loop-v2-mvp-proposal-v0.4.md:102`) is
the operator's judgment on usefulness, not a unit count or a green harness. Three genuine units had
closed; the evidence split cleanly between what the loop's review caught and what its bookkeeping
cost, and Core § 2's Direct Work bypass had never fired once across all three units.

**Decision:** Exit accepted. The loop helped get real work done, and the shape it did it in is not
the shape to keep. Direction set for a v0.2 rework: keep the adversarial review — the component the
evidence supports without qualification — and shed most of the bookkeeping (state-file ceremony, turn
flags, unit numbering, the operator as message bus). Scope and shape are **not** decided here.

**Rationale:** Codex found two real defects in Claude's work that Claude's own passing test harness
reported as absent; a self-review cannot supply that. Against it, one checkbox tick went through a
brief, a premise check, a hand-back, an operator stop, a state-file edit and a commit. And condition 5
— the bypass meant to keep small reversible work *out* of the loop — never fired in three consecutive
genuine units. A bypass that never fires is a rule on paper, and that negative result is treated as
the strongest single input to the v0.2 rework, not as an unresolved pilot obligation.

**Alternatives considered:**
1. Exit accepted, keep the current shape — rejected; the bookkeeping cost is the evidence against it.
2. Not yet, keep piloting — rejected; would also require closing the CRM/Email OS domain gap for real
   rather than by amendment (see the paired decision below), at further session cost.

**Recorded:** `plans/work-loop-v2-mvp/step-7-pilot-log.md` § The decision;
`logs/missions/work-loop-v2-mvp.md` Step 7 thread.

## 2026-08-01 — Work Loop v2 mission acceptance assertion 8 amended

**Context:** Session S14-198, decided alongside the pilot exit above. The mission's frozen acceptance
assertion read "At least two real CRM / Email OS units have completed through the loop." All three
pilot units were genuine `ai-resources` / `axcion-systems-builder` infrastructure work; "CRM" and
"Email OS" appear exactly once in the 774-line pilot log, in the standing constraint that named them.

**Decision:** Amend the assertion to "at least two genuine units — work the operator wanted done
anyway, never manufactured." The named domain changes; the substance does not.

**Rationale:** The constraint that actually governed the pilot throughout (`step-7-pilot-log.md:86`,
"genuine units only … a manufactured unit tests nothing") was met in full by all three units. Reading
the original wording as satisfied would have been false — the pilot never touched CRM or Email OS.
Leaving it frozen and unmet would have blocked mission completion on a label mismatch rather than on
missing evidence. This is the second amendment to this frozen contract; the freeze otherwise stands,
matching how the mission's one prior amendment (destination behaviour 1, Step 3) was handled.

**Alternatives considered:**
1. Leave frozen, record as not satisfied — rejected; honest but blocks on wording, not evidence.
2. Run one real CRM or Email OS unit to close it as literally written — rejected; would cost a further
   session testing nothing the pilot hadn't already tested, and is inconsistent with the exit decision
   just taken.

**Recorded:** `logs/missions/work-loop-v2-mvp.md`, acceptance assertion 8.
