## 2026-05-22 — wrap: graduate-resource sweep session

### Summary
Wrap of the graduate-resource workspace sweep session. Candidates report saved to disk; session notes written mid-session. Telemetry and coaching skipped per preflight.

### Files Created
- `reports/graduate-resource-candidates-2026-05-22.md` — tiered graduation candidates from full workspace sweep

### Files Modified
- `logs/session-notes.md` — session entry + archive (8 entries archived, 10 kept)
- `logs/session-notes-archive-2026-05.md` — archive file updated by check-archive.sh

### Decisions Made
- None (discovery/sweep session; no structural decisions).

### Next Steps
- Pick up graduation work from `reports/graduate-resource-candidates-2026-05-22.md`:
  - Tier 1: `/graduate-resource check-claim-ids` → research-workflow hooks
  - Tier 2: `/graduate-resource friction-log-trigger` → shared hooks (loose-end resolution)
  - Tier 3: ai-development-lab bundle → new workflow template (larger scope)
  - Registry cleanup: update `resolve-improvement-log` registry entry → `graduated`

### Open Questions
- None.

## 2026-05-22 — Created grill-me skill — pre-planning interview with mandate brief output

### Summary
Evaluated a "grill skill" concept from a source brief, scoped and planned the implementation via /clarify + /scope, then built and shipped the `grill-me` skill in the same session. The skill forces relentless interviewing before any plan is written, walks the design tree top-down, and produces a structured mandate brief as its output. Two integration points were added: a pointer in `/context-builder` (project-planning entry point) and in `/create-skill` Step 1 decision point.

### Files Created
- `skills/grill-me/SKILL.md` — full skill: 13 sections including bias countering, bike-shedding stop, artifact scan, worked example
- `.claude/commands/grill-me.md` — command stub invoking the skill

### Files Modified
- `.claude/commands/create-skill.md` — Step 1 decision point: recommend /grill-me for thin briefs
- `projects/project-planning/.claude/commands/context-builder.md` — top-of-file pointer: run /grill-me when scope is fuzzy (separate repo, committed separately)

### Decisions Made
- **Single skill only:** `grill-me` (plain interview), no `grill-with-docs` variant — docs layer deferred until plain version is validated in practice
- **Not wired into harness session start or /new-project pipeline** — user-initiated only (`disable-model-invocation: true`)
- **Target use cases:** (1) before project plan / context pack creation, (2) before complex /create-skill or /improve-skill brief
- **Handoff artifact:** structured mandate brief (one page max), written to `output/{project}/grill-mandate.md`
- **Integration point:** command-level pointer (not SKILL.md) — per operator direction, pointer lives in the command pipeline
- **Bike-shedding stop:** ~3 rounds per concept, then offer to lock and move on
- **QC findings fixed (4 total):** `disable-model-invocation` added; slash-command contradiction resolved (command file added); missing SKILL.md sections added (Runtime Recommendations, Bias Countering, Examples); Fit Assessment added to plan

### Next Steps
- Push all three repos (ai-resources × 2 commits, project-planning × 1 commit)
- First real use: run `/grill-me` before next project plan or complex skill creation to validate the interview flow and mandate brief output

### Open Questions
- None.

## 2026-05-22 — Built /handoff unified session-state skill

### Summary
Built the `/handoff` command + skill: a unified two-mode session handoff that replaces `/save-session`. Continuity mode (no args) saves full session state to `logs/scratchpads/` for same-session resume after `/clear`; fork mode (with args) compresses a scoped task to `/tmp/` for pickup by a child session. Consulted the System Owner twice — once on architecture (command → skill, no subagent), once on the automation path (next session: wire into `/wrap-session` + `/prime`). Two QC passes and two plan iterations before execution.

### Files Created
- `skills/handoff/SKILL.md` — unified skill, both modes
- `.claude/commands/handoff.md` — thin dispatcher command
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-05-22-11-53-scratchpad.md` — session scratchpad (continuity handoff)
- `audits/risk-checks/2026-05-22-new-skill-skills-handoff-skill-md-and-new-command-claude.md` — plan-time risk-check (PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION, mitigations applied)

### Files Modified
- `.claude/commands/save-session.md` — replaced with self-documenting compatibility redirect
- `skills/ai-resource-builder/references/operational-frontmatter.md` — tier table: `save-session` → `handoff`

### Decisions Made
- **Architecture:** Command → skill, no subagent. Subagents start with no session context; skill runs in main session where conversation context is available.
- **Unified two-mode design:** Args presence drives mode — no flags. No-args = continuity (`logs/scratchpads/`); with-args = fork (`/tmp/`).
- **save-session deprecated, not deleted:** 11 project symlinks kept live pointing at the redirect stub; clean up via `/fix-symlinks` when convenient.
- **Onboarding docs skipped** per operator instruction.
- **`shared-manifest.json` step dropped:** File doesn't exist in `ai-resources/`; auto-sync hook discovers commands automatically.
- **Automation: Option A + /prime half, SessionStop hook deferred.** Hooks can't generate AI scratchpad content. Right path: add `/handoff` as Step 0.5 in `/wrap-session`, add scratchpad detection to `/prime`. Unplanned-exit gap deliberately left open.
- **End-time risk-check skipped:** Plan-time gate ran (PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION, all mitigations applied), commits shipped (75f2e53), no drift from plan. Skip per skip rule, documented here.

### Next Steps
Implement `/wrap-session` + `/prime` auto-handoff integration (System Owner advisory). Full 4-step plan in `logs/scratchpads/2026-05-22-11-53-scratchpad.md`. Start with `/prime` in a new session — it will surface the scratchpad's Resume With section.

### Open Questions
- None.

## 2026-05-22 — /friday-checkup weekly tier (9 scopes)

### Summary
Ran the weekly-tier `/friday-checkup` cadence across 9 scopes (ai-resources, workspace, 7 projects). Operator confirmed weekly tier and approved a long run (~178 min formula ceiling). Executed all weekly auto-run checks: `/audit-repo` ×3, `/improve` ×3, `/coach` ×7, `/permission-sweep --dry-run`, `/log-sweep --dry-run`, plus W2.1 doc-scanner and W2.3 maintenance consolidator (incl. `/kb-integrity`) for repo-documentation. All 3 deployed `/audit-repo` scopes returned GREEN with 0 Critical / 0 Important. 5 HIGH-priority findings surfaced — none CRITICAL. Consolidated review-only report written; no fixes auto-applied.

### Files Created
- `audits/friday-checkup-2026-05-22.md` — consolidated weekly checkup report
- `audits/repo-health-ai-resources-2026-05-22.md` — dated repo-health snapshot
- `audits/repo-health-project-global-macro-analysis-2026-05-22.md` — dated snapshot
- `audits/repo-health-project-nordic-pe-macro-landscape-H1-2026-2026-05-22.md` — dated snapshot
- `audits/permission-sweep-2026-05-22.md` — dry-run permission report (0 CRITICAL, 2 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM, 6 advisory)
- `audits/log-sweep-2026-05-22.md` — dry-run log-sweep report (12 scopes, 3 over threshold)
- `audits/working/permission-sweep-2026-05-22.md` + `.summary.md` — auditor working notes
- `audits/working/log-sweep-*-2026-05-22.md` (12 per-scope working notes) + `log-sweep-manifest-2026-05-22.md`
- `projects/ai-development-lab/logs/coaching-log.md` — created (first coaching run, baseline)
- `projects/repo-documentation/output/phase-2/w2-1-doc-scan-2026-05-22.md` — W2.1 component-drift scan
- `projects/repo-documentation/output/phase-2/w2-3-maintenance-2026-05-22.md` — W2.3 consolidated maintenance summary
- `projects/repo-documentation/vault/_integrity-report-2026-05-22.md` — `/kb-integrity` vault scan

### Files Modified
- `reports/repo-health-report.md` (ai-resources; prior archived to `repo-health-report-2026-05-16.md`)
- `projects/global-macro-analysis/reports/repo-health-report.md` (prior archived `repo-health-report-2026-04-11.md`)
- `projects/nordic-pe-macro-landscape-H1-2026/reports/repo-health-report.md` (prior archived `repo-health-report-2026-05-16.md`)
- `logs/improvement-log.md` (ai-resources — 4 entries logged)
- `projects/global-macro-analysis/logs/improvement-log.md` (4 entries + 1 RECURRING escalation note)
- `projects/nordic-pe-macro-landscape-H1-2026/logs/improvement-log.md` (5 entries logged, incl. 1 HIGH)
- `logs/coaching-log.md` (ai-resources) + coaching-log appends for axcion-ai-system-owner, global-macro-analysis, nordic-pe-macro-landscape-H1-2026, obsidian-pe-kb, project-planning

### Decisions Made
- Tier: weekly (auto-detected, operator-confirmed). Scopes: ai-resources, workspace + 7 projects (operator-selected).
- `/log-sweep --dry-run` scope pick: chose "All scopes" without re-prompting — read-only dry-run inside an already-approved cadence; re-prompting would be redundant friction (decision-point posture).
- `/improve` findings logged, not applied — `/friday-checkup` is review-only; findings direct next week's work.
- findings-extractor over-escalated the `model`-field permission finding to CRITICAL; the consolidated report uses the authoritative source severity (MEDIUM per the permission-sweep report).
- Two `/coach` runs (ai-development-lab, axcion-ai-system-owner) mis-resolved project paths on first invocation and were re-run with explicit absolute-path directives.

### Next Steps
- Review `audits/friday-checkup-2026-05-22.md`. Run `/friday-so` (System Owner advisory on the checkup), then `/friday-act` (operator-driven fixes) — the next two Friday-cadence sessions.
- Top two follow-ups: (1) port the 3 verified `/session-plan` edits into nordic-pe's project-LOCAL `.claude/commands/session-plan.md` (verified against canonical only — project still runs un-fixed code); (2) approve + build the global-macro concurrent-session detection hook (improvement-log #3, RECURRING, leaked 3×, Autonomy Rule #8).
- 22 tactical follow-ups total — see the report's Tactical follow-ups section.

### Open Questions
- `/prime` reported 0 unpushed commits in ai-resources at session start; the Step 6 git check found 5 unpushed. No commits were made by this checkup (review-only) — likely concurrent-session commits. Verify before pushing.

## 2026-05-22 — Implement /wrap-session + /prime auto-handoff integration

### Summary
Resumed from `logs/scratchpads/2026-05-22-11-53-scratchpad.md` and implemented the System Owner advisory (decisions.md 2026-05-22 Decision 3): wiring `/handoff` continuity mode into the session lifecycle. `/wrap-session` now writes a continuity scratchpad as a new Step 0.5; `/prime` detects the newest scratchpad and surfaces it as a `**Resumable scratchpad:**` brief field; the `handoff` skill's end-of-session-wrap boundary was reworded so it no longer contradicts `/wrap-session` calling it internally. Plan-time `/risk-check` ran (PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION); all 3 mitigations were applied.

### Files Created
- `audits/risk-checks/2026-05-22-wire-handoff-continuity-mode-into-the-session-lifecycle-per.md` — plan-time risk-check report
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-05-22-12-39-scratchpad.md` — continuity scratchpad (first run of the new Step 0.5)

### Files Modified
- `.claude/commands/wrap-session.md` — new Step 0.5: inline `/handoff` continuity-mode write
- `.claude/commands/prime.md` — new Step 1b: scratchpad detection (lexical filename sort) + `**Resumable scratchpad:**` brief field
- `skills/handoff/SKILL.md` — end-of-session-wrap boundary reworded (frontmatter description, Purpose, "Do NOT use for")
- `.claude/commands/handoff.md` — clarifying note matching the boundary rewording

### Decisions Made
- **Risk-check mitigations (all 3 applied):** M1 — `handoff` boundary wording made consistent across all four edits; M2 — `/prime` Step 1b specified to sort scratchpads lexically by filename, not mtime; M3 — `logs/scratchpads/` retention gap flagged in the commit message and follow-ups.
- **End-time `/risk-check` skipped.** Plan-time gate ran (PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION), all 3 mitigations applied, zero drift between planned and executed change set, integration commit `24feef1` shipped. Skip per the documented end-time skip rule.
- **`session-notes.md` excluded from commit `24feef1`.** A concurrent `/friday-checkup` session left an uncommitted entry in `session-notes.md`; staging the file would have swept that entry into the integration commit. Left for this wrap.

### Next Steps
- **Push** — multiple commits unpushed in `ai-resources` (integration `24feef1` + this wrap commit + prior).
- **`logs/scratchpads/` retention** (risk-check M3) — extend `check-archive.sh` or `/log-sweep` to prune old scratchpads. Also rename or remove `2026-05-22-14-00-scratchpad.md`, whose filename time is ~2.5h ahead of its real mtime — it currently out-sorts newer scratchpads in `/prime` Step 1b.
- **Orphaned `/friday-checkup` work** — a concurrent session left an uncommitted `session-notes.md` entry plus untracked `audits/friday-checkup-2026-05-22.md` and sibling audit files; decide whether to commit them.
- **Deferred graduation work** from `reports/graduate-resource-candidates-2026-05-22.md` — `check-claim-ids`, `friction-log-trigger`, the ai-development-lab bundle.

### Open Questions
- None.

## 2026-05-22 — /friday-journal resumed: completed Steps 5.6–7, journal archived

### Summary
Resumed the interrupted `/friday-journal` pipeline from scratchpad `2026-05-22-14-00-scratchpad.md` (via `/prime`). Re-verified the deterministic checks (Step 5.4 mechanical, 5.6 drop-check, 5.7 risk-class scan) directly against the files rather than trusting the scratchpad's "effectively complete" claims — all passed. Confirmed-then-archived the 5 journal entries to `## Archive — 2026-05-22` after the operator questioned the archive four times; clarified that archiving is a reversible within-file move and that none of the 5 report items are implemented yet. Pipeline complete; report awaits `/friday-act`.

### Files Created
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-05-22-16-30-scratchpad.md` — continuity scratchpad (wrap-session Step 0.5)

### Files Modified
- `logs/ai-journal.md` — Step 6 archive: 5 active entries moved to a new `## Archive — 2026-05-22` block; active section cleared
- `logs/session-notes.md` — this entry
- `audits/friday-journal-2026-05-22.md` — report finalized (pipeline completed this session; file authored in the prior interrupted session, never committed)
- `audits/working/journal-qc-2026-05-22.md` — QC working notes (authored in prior session; committed now as friday-journal output)

### Decisions Made
- **Archived the journal (operator confirmed `y`).** Operator questioned the archive four times before confirming. Clarified: archiving is a within-file move (active → archive section), reversible via `git checkout`, and touches none of the 5 implementation-target files. None of the 5 report items are implemented — they are tracked in the report, awaiting `/friday-act`.
- **Did not commit inside `/friday-journal` (followed Step 7 sub-step 20 over the scratchpad).** The `2026-05-22-14-00` scratchpad's "Resume With" step 7 said to commit; the command spec says "Do NOT commit." Command spec is authoritative — output folds into a later commit boundary. This wrap-session commits the pipeline output.

### Next Steps
- Run `/friday-act` by **2026-05-29** — `audits/friday-journal-2026-05-22.md` has a 7-day freshness window (`/friday-act` Step 1.5 only auto-loads journal reports ≤ 7 days old). Past that date, re-run `/friday-journal` (raw notes safe in the journal archive) to regenerate an in-window report.
- All 5 report items are flagged `Risk-check required` — `/friday-act` must run `/risk-check` on each before landing.

### Open Questions
- None.

## 2026-05-22 — /friday-act planning — implementation plans for weekly checkup

**Mandate:** Disposition 2026-05-22 weekly checkup findings + journal items + innovation sweep; produce 8 implementation plan files for follow-up sessions — done when: 8 plan files written and committed; maintenance-observations.md session block appended
- Out of scope: Implementation of plan items (deferred to next session)
- Files in scope: (inferred)
- Stop if: (none stated)

Class: planning
Mandate: Run /friday-act to disposition the 2026-05-22 weekly checkup findings and produce implementation plan files; implementation itself deferred to follow-up sessions. Include innovation sweep in plans.

### Summary
Ran `/friday-act` for the 2026-05-22 weekly `/friday-checkup`. Dispositioned 27 items (22 checkup tactical follow-ups + 5 journal-derived items) into 23 fix-now, 3 defer, 1 skip — applied via `/recommend` after the operator delegated disposition judgment. Produced 8 grouped implementation plan files in `audits/friday-plans/`; implementation deferred to follow-up sessions. Ran an innovation sweep (0 graduate, 0 backport) and an independent `/qc-pass` after the operator asked — QC returned REVISE with one defect (4 incorrect risk-check annotations), fixed and committed.

### Files Created
- `audits/friday-plans/2026-05-22-permissions.md` — 4 items (settings.json permission fixes)
- `audits/friday-plans/2026-05-22-session-plan.md` — 1 item (nordic-pe local session-plan port, HIGH)
- `audits/friday-plans/2026-05-22-check-concurrent-session.md` — 1 item (global-macro hook, HIGH RECURRING, Rule #8 gate)
- `audits/friday-plans/2026-05-22-improvement-log.md` — 3 items (11-entry triage, gate calibration, deferred entries)
- `audits/friday-plans/2026-05-22-log-sweep.md` — 2 items (auditor heuristic fix, archival run)
- `audits/friday-plans/2026-05-22-repo-documentation.md` — 3 items (vault schema re-author, W2.3 triage, renames)
- `audits/friday-plans/2026-05-22-general.md` — 4 items + innovation sweep appendix
- `audits/friday-plans/2026-05-22-journal-commands.md` — 5 items (CLAUDE.md rule + 4 command improvements)
- `audits/working/innovation-sweep-2026-05-22.md` — innovation sweep working notes (gitignored)
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-05-22-14-18-scratchpad.md` — continuity scratchpad

### Files Modified
- `logs/maintenance-observations.md` — 2026-05-22 Friday Act session block
- `logs/friction-log.md` — new 2026-05-22 14:14 session block + 1 entry (qc-pass-should-be-automatic)
- `logs/session-notes.md` — session header, mandate, this wrap entry
- `logs/decisions.md` — risk-check change-class interpretation decision
- `logs/coaching-data.md` — session profile entry
- `logs/usage-log.md` — session telemetry entry

### Decisions Made
- **Disposition** (23 fix-now / 3 defer / 1 skip) — applied via `/recommend`; the 23 fix-now items grouped into 8 plan files by area.
- **Autonomy axes for the week ahead:** Guardrails → tighten (rubber-stamp gate, 4th cycle), Reliability → tighten (concurrent-session collision 3×); all others hold.
- **QC fix:** 4 plan items corrected from `Risk-check yes` → `no` — command-file edits and agent-definition edits are not canonical `/risk-check` change classes per `audit-discipline.md`. Logged to `decisions.md`.

### Next Steps
- **Push** — multiple unpushed commits in `ai-resources` (operator gate).
- **Execute the 8 plan files** in follow-up sessions. Suggested order: `session-plan` (HIGH) → `permissions` (HIGH) → `check-concurrent-session` (HIGH RECURRING — Autonomy Rule #8 approval required first) → `journal-commands` (2 HIGH operator-requested items) → remaining. *(Note: a concurrent `/friday-act execution` session began executing the ungated plans during this wrap.)*
- Consider `/improve` — a friction event was logged this session.

### Open Questions
- Should agent-definition edits be added to the canonical `/risk-check` change-class list in `audit-discipline.md`? `log-sweep.md` #1 is currently set to `no` per the canonical text; improvement-log 2026-04-28 (unratified) argues they should count.

## 2026-05-22 — /friday-act execution — clear the ungated plan files

Class: execution

**Mandate:** Execute the 3 ungated friday-act plans (session-plan, log-sweep, improvement-log) plus general items #4 and #3, committing each fix separately — done when: the 3 plan files are cleared and general #3/#4 done, each committed, and the push is offered at session end (re-verified against all unpushed commits).
- Out of scope: general #1 /cleanup-worktree (operator-deferred this session); permissions plan, check-concurrent-session plan, journal-commands plan, repo-documentation plan (all gated or out-of-project-scope); improvement-log #3 is booking a review-cycle session, not executing the 2 re-deferred fixes.
- Files in scope: nordic-pe .claude/commands/session-plan.md + logs/improvement-log.md + shared-manifest.json; ai-resources .claude/agents/log-sweep-auditor.md + logs/gate-calibration.md + logs/improvement-log.md; /log-sweep archive files (inferred)
- Stop if: a deferred-plan gate is hit; general #3 concludes 'archive' (Autonomy Rule #3 pause); operator declines push.

### Summary
Executed the 4 ungated friday-act plan files from the 2026-05-22 weekly checkup — `session-plan`, `log-sweep`, and `improvement-log` fully, plus `general` items 3 and 4. Ran `/qc-pass` on the proposed session-scoping triage before locking the mandate (REVISE → all 4 fixes applied). 13 commits across 4 repos. A concurrent `/friday-act journal-commands` session ran in parallel with no target-file overlap and appears to have wrapped (commit `9d5c01c`).

### Files Created
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-05-22-14-57-scratchpad.md` — continuity scratchpad
- `projects/buy-side-service-plan/logs/decisions-archive-2026-04.md` — 17 archived decisions entries (log-sweep)
- `projects/nordic-pe-macro-landscape-H1-2026/logs/decisions-archive-2026-05.md` — 17 archived decisions entries appended (log-sweep)

### Files Modified
- `logs/session-plan.md` — this session's plan (overwrote the stale 2026-05-18 plan)
- `logs/session-notes.md` — mandate + this wrap entry
- ai-resources: `.claude/agents/log-sweep-auditor.md` (Cat A2 doc-file exclusion), `logs/gate-calibration.md` (first entry), `logs/improvement-log.md` (booking + triage block), `audits/log-sweep-2026-05-22.md` (apply report)
- nordic-pe: `.claude/commands/session-plan.md` (3-edit port), `.claude/shared-manifest.json` (resync), `logs/improvement-log.md` (standing rule + triage block), `logs/decisions.md` (archived 606→97 lines)
- buy-side: `logs/decisions.md` (archived 405→57 lines)
- global-macro: `logs/improvement-log.md` (triage block)

### Decisions Made
- **Session scoping** — 4 ungated plans executed; 4 deferred (permissions, check-concurrent-session = Autonomy Rule #8; journal-commands = heavy build, done by the concurrent session; repo-documentation = separate project + heavy). `/qc-pass` REVISE → 4 fixes applied before the mandate was locked.
- **general #4** — included `fix-symlinks` in the manifest resync: a genuine 3rd discrepancy beyond the plan's named 2 (`project-status`, `produce-jargon-gloss`).
- **improvement-log #2** — recalibrate (not retire) the `bright-line-review` gate; logged to `gate-calibration.md` (first entry there).
- **general #3** — `prose-refinement-writer`: keep (recent, unwired). `fund-triage-scanner`: archive-candidate — **paused per Autonomy Rule #3**, surfaced for operator decision, not archived.
- **End-time `/risk-check` skipped** — no canonical structural change class touched: edits to existing command/agent files + log appends; no hooks, settings.json, CLAUDE.md, new commands/skills, or symlinks.

### Next Steps
- **Push all 4 repos** — operator approved (this wrap commits first).
- Decide `fund-triage-scanner`: archive, or keep if a PE-fund-screening project is planned.
- Wire `prose-refinement-writer` into the research-workflow prose stage (R1 remediation Phase B follow-up).
- Durable enforcement of the `bright-line-review` recalibration needs an always-loaded CLAUDE.md rule — a separate gated item.
- Other projects with a `local` `session-plan` command may need the same 3-edit port — the new "Local commands verify per-copy" rule (nordic-pe improvement-log) covers the principle.
- Remaining friday-act plans: permissions (Rule #8), check-concurrent-session (Rule #8 + `/risk-check`), repo-documentation; journal-commands appears done by the concurrent session — verify.
- Booked: 2026-05-26 dedicated session for the 2 re-deferred improvement-log entries.

### Open Questions
- None.

## 2026-05-22 — /friday-act journal-commands plan execution

**Mandate:** Execute the 5-item journal-commands /friday-act plan (`audits/friday-plans/2026-05-22-journal-commands.md`): item 1 (between-gate executive-summary rule → workspace CLAUDE.md), item 2 (wire system-owner gate into /new-project Stage 3b→3c), item 3 (system-owner second-opinion step in /risk-check), items 4-5 (new /drift-check and /resolve-repo-problem commands).
- In scope: the 5 plan items; /risk-check gates on items 1, 4, 5; one commit per item.
- Concurrent session: a separate `/friday-act execution` session is clearing the ungated plans and explicitly deferred journal-commands — no target-file overlap; both sessions append to session-notes.md.
- Stop if: a risk-check verdict returns RECONSIDER.

Class: implementation

### Summary
Executed the 5-item journal-commands `/friday-act` plan (`audits/friday-plans/2026-05-22-journal-commands.md`) to completion. Plan-time `/risk-check` returned PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION; all 4 mitigations were applied and QC-confirmed PASS. `/qc-pass` returned REVISE on one finding (command-vs-skill invocation wording), which was resolved. End-time `/risk-check` was skipped per the documented skip rule. One commit per item, six commits total across two repos.

### Files Created
- `.claude/commands/drift-check.md` — new advisory command: mid-session trajectory drift check (item 4)
- `.claude/commands/resolve-repo-problem.md` — new advisory command: repo-error diagnosis + 3-option fix plan (item 5)
- `audits/risk-checks/2026-05-22-three-structural-additions-from-the-journal-commands-friday.md` — plan-time risk-check report
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-05-22-14-44-scratchpad.md` — session continuity scratchpad

### Files Modified
- `Axcion AI Repo/CLAUDE.md` (workspace-level — separate repo from `ai-resources`) — "Between-gate summaries" bullet added under `## Working Principles` (item 1); commit `e258bb8`
- `.claude/commands/new-project.md` — `## Stage 3b → 3c Architecture Gate` section added (item 2); Skill-tool dispatch wording clarified (QC fix)
- `.claude/commands/risk-check.md` — `### Step 4a: System-Owner Second Opinion` added (item 3); Skill-tool dispatch wording clarified (QC fix)
- `logs/session-notes.md` — this entry

### Decisions Made
- **Plan-time `/risk-check` run once for the whole plan** — per `risk-check.md`'s "plan-time fires once" rule, items 1/4/5 were covered in a single gate, not three separate runs.
- **Item 1 (M1 mitigation):** rule condensed to 52 words inline (~80 tokens), no separate docs file — the ≤55-word / ≤90-token budget is met by tightening alone; a docs-offload for a 52-word rule would be over-engineering.
- **Item 2:** added defensive handling beyond the plan's literal verdict cases — `DECLINE`/unparseable verdict and `/implementation-triage`'s own failure both fall through to "proceed" so an advisory gate cannot block the pipeline.
- **Items 4–5 built as commands, not skills** — the plan's primary target; the "consider a full skill" fallback did not apply to single-purpose advisory commands.
- **Model tier:** both new commands declare `model: opus`, joining the advisory-command family (`/risk-check`, `/implementation-triage`, `/consult` — all opus). QC flagged `/resolve-repo-problem` as borderline (pure-dispatch leans sonnet by the workspace rule); kept opus for family consistency — operator may reconsider.
- **End-time `/risk-check` skipped** — plan-time gate covered the exact in-class change set (workspace CLAUDE.md + 2 new commands), all 4 mitigations applied and QC-confirmed, commits shipped, zero drift between planned and executed change set. Skip per the documented end-time skip rule.
- *QC fix (separate from plan items):* `/qc-pass` REVISE — the "skill (Skill tool)" wording for invoking command files (`/implementation-triage`, `/consult`) read as a command-vs-skill mismatch. Skill-tool dispatch of `.claude/commands/*.md` confirmed working empirically (`/risk-check` and `/qc-pass` invoked via Skill tool this session). Wording tightened in both files; commit `0a3beba`.

### Next Steps
- **Push** — workspace `Axcion AI Repo` repo: 2 unpushed (`5b03877` concurrent governance-rules session, `e258bb8` this session). `ai-resources`: 5 this session (`c43d386`, `4494e96`, `249aee2`, `1529adf`, `0a3beba`) on top of 3 prior — 8 total unpushed. Operator-gated.
- **Scratchpad clock-skew bug (now misrouting `/prime`)** — `logs/scratchpads/` filenames `14-00` and `16-30` are skewed ahead of real time; `/prime` Step 1b sorts lexically, so it will surface the stale `16-30` scratchpad instead of this session's true-latest `2026-05-22-14-44-scratchpad.md`. This is the deferred scratchpad-retention work (risk-check M3 from the handoff-integration session) — now actively biting; worth prioritizing.
- **Remaining `/friday-act` plans** — a concurrent `/friday-act execution` session cleared the 4 ungated plans; `check-concurrent-session` and `repo-documentation` plans remain deferred.

## 2026-05-22 — Add four governance rules to workspace CLAUDE.md

### Summary
Operator invoked `/clarify` on a request to place five proposed governance rules into CLAUDE.md, deciding project-specific vs. workspace-wide for each. Surfaced four clarifying questions (conflict with the Autonomy Rules, section placement, context-monitoring feasibility, git-status conflict); operator invoked `/recommend` to self-resolve them. Made four edits to the workspace-level CLAUDE.md, each folded into an existing section rather than creating new parallel sections. `/qc-pass` returned GO with one note; operator confirmed dropping the literal `~30%` threshold. Committed `5b03877` to the `Axcion AI Repo` (workspace) repo.

### Files Created
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-05-22-14-21-scratchpad.md` — session continuity scratchpad

### Files Modified
- `Axcion AI Repo/CLAUDE.md` (workspace-level — separate repo from `ai-resources`) — four governance rules added, committed `5b03877`

### Decisions Made
- **Placement:** all four rules to workspace CLAUDE.md, folded into existing sections (QC Independence Rule, Plan Mode Discipline, Working Principles, File verification and git commits). No new parallel sections — avoids token bloat and contradiction surface.
- **Item 2 (post-plan approval gate):** scoped to plan-mode only — wait for confirmation after plan delivery before implementation. Not a global override of the Autonomy Rules / Decision-Point Posture.
- **Item 3 (context monitoring):** reframed as a heuristic ("context clearly constrained"); literal `~30%` threshold and `ExitPlanMode` phrasing dropped per operator.
- **Item 5 (git status):** added as a scoped `### Repo-status reporting` subsection; existing self-verification rule left intact.
- **Item 4 ("Plan only / STOP"):** treated as a one-time session directive — not added to any CLAUDE.md.

### Next Steps
- **Push** — commit `5b03877` in the `Axcion AI Repo` repo is unpushed (operator gate). Prior wrap also flagged separate unpushed commits in `ai-resources`.
