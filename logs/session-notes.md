## 2026-06-08 — Session S6: verified prime carryover staleness — 3 of 4 already done, 1 symlink fixed

### Summary
`/prime` surfaced two carryover items; operator suspected some were already done and asked to verify against the logs + live filesystem. Confirmed: of four open items (QC pass, symlink, commit loose notes, claim-permission wiring), **three were already resolved** — QC done in S5 (3/3 GO; signal was stale because S5's wrap note was written-but-uncommitted at prime time), claim-permission pointer-removal done+committed by a live concurrent S3 session, and the ai-resources loose-notes commit self-resolved (committed by another session). The only genuinely-open item was a broken symlink, which was fixed. Detected the live concurrent S3 session via mtime (a shared file changed between two of my own reads) and correctly halted the first auto attempt to avoid a lost-update collision, resuming only after that session had wrapped and committed.

### Files Created
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-06-08-18-30-scratchpad.md` — continuity scratchpad (gitignored)

### Files Modified
- Removed `projects/research-pe-regime-shift-advisory-gap/.claude/commands/diagnostics-plan.md` — orphaned broken symlink (target `ai-resources/.claude/commands/diagnostics-plan.md` does not exist anywhere; gitignored/untracked path, no commit needed)
- `logs/.session-marker` + per-id marker → S6

### Decisions Made
- **Symlink removed, not re-pointed.** No canonical `diagnostics-plan.md` exists anywhere in ai-resources, so the link is orphaned (a command never created or since removed). Removal is the correct ZERO-match resolution, not a re-point.
- **Halted auto run on concurrent-session detection.** When a live S3 session was detected mid-edit in the research-pe repo, stopped the auto run rather than editing/committing there — avoided a lost-update collision. Resumed once that session wrapped (12:11) and its work was in HEAD.

### Risky actions
Nearly committed/edited the research-pe repo while a live concurrent S3 session was mid-edit on `quality-standards.md` — caught it via mtime before acting and halted. No collision occurred. The symlink removal was on a gitignored, untracked path (no shared-state effect).

### Next Steps
Push gate: 12 commits across ai-resources (8), workspace-root (2), ai-development-lab (2). research-pe has no upstream — nothing to push there.

### Open Questions
None.

## 2026-06-09 — refresh-project-state build, Session 1 (design + gates + dev build)

### Summary
Session 1 of a deliberate two-session split for the `refresh-project-state` workflow (on-demand Strategic Context Snapshot of every Axcíon project → collected into the `knowledge-bases/strategic-os/` vault → read directly by the OS). This session covered design + gates + dev build only — no canonical or shared-state writes landed. Folded the gated build order and the vault governance amendment wording into the design spec, built three DEV artifacts in `workflows/` (not graduated), QC'd them, and ran the plan-time `/risk-check`. Stopped at the gate as planned. Cross-project session (cwd ai-resources; spec lives in strategic-os).

### Files Created
- `ai-resources/workflows/refresh-project-state/.claude/commands/refresh-project-state.md` — DEV orchestrator command (model: sonnet), banner-marked, not graduated/symlinked.
- `ai-resources/workflows/refresh-project-state/.claude/agents/project-state-snapshot-agent.md` — DEV per-project snapshot agent (model: sonnet).
- `ai-resources/workflows/refresh-project-state/.claude/agents/project-state-scrub-verifier.md` — DEV two-pass scrub-verifier (model: sonnet).
- `ai-resources/audits/risk-checks/2026-06-09-refresh-project-state-vault-governance-amendment.md` — risk-check report (PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION) + appended system-owner commentary.
- `projects/strategic-os/logs/scratchpads/2026-06-09-11-09-scratchpad.md` — Session-2 continuity scratchpad.
- `projects/axcion-ai-system-owner/output/consultations/consult-2026-06-09-refresh-project-state-package-risk-check-second-opinion.md` — system-owner Function-B advisory.

### Files Modified
- `projects/strategic-os/docs/project-state-workflow-spec.md` — added §14 (gated build order + Session-2 GO-gates inline), §15 (amendment wording — 3 canonical-only sites + vault-identity sentence), §13 criterion-4 rollback scope note.

### Decisions Made
- Two-session split at the `/risk-check` gate (operator-chosen; Session 1 stops at GO/NO-GO).
- Spec fold-in = in-place edit (git history), not a v2 file.
- Dev home = `ai-resources/workflows/refresh-project-state/` (per `/placement`; the top-level `workflows/` workspace named in workspace CLAUDE.md does not exist on disk).
- Scrub-verifier = ONE agent running both passes (deterministic + semantic), not two.
- `auto` snapshots emit `Related: []` empty (operator curates links later).
- §15 amendment wording EXTENDED beyond operator-supplied verbatim text — operator gave 1 canonical-only site (Rule 2); QC found a 2nd (Query-mode), risk-check found a 3rd (`/kb-query`); plus a vault-identity exception sentence (system-owner). Recorded inline in §15.

### Risky actions
None irreversible. Near-flag: extended the operator-supplied §15 amendment wording (recorded inline in the spec, flagged in chat for operator confirmation before Session 2 lands). No gate mis-fired; no prompt injection. End-time `/risk-check` deliberately skipped — see Next Steps (plan-time gate covered the package; nothing structural landed this session).

### Next Steps
- Operator: confirm the §15 amendment-wording extension is acceptable.
- Session 2 (fresh context): `/prime` in `projects/strategic-os` → it detects the continuity scratchpad → re-read spec §13–§15 → satisfy the three GO-gates (G1 structural deny rules, G2 folder-scoped Write, G3 rollback test) → scaffold vault + apply amendment → graduate the 3 dev artifacts → wire OS `state-retrieval-agent` → dry-run one project → full run → §13 acceptance. Run end-time `/risk-check` before the Session-2 commit.

### Open Questions
- §15 amendment-wording extension awaits operator confirmation (non-blocking for Session 1; blocking before Session 2 lands the amendment).

## 2026-06-09 — Session S1
**Mandate:** refresh-project-state Session 2 — land + wire + validate (satisfy GO-gates G1/G2/G3, scaffold vault project-state/, apply §15 amendment to 3 sites + identity sentence, extend /kb-integrity Check D, graduate 3 dev artifacts, wire OS state-retrieval-agent) — done when: all 3 GO-gates satisfied structurally, §15 landed at all 3 sites, 3 artifacts graduated + wired, end-time /risk-check GO, dry-run + full run pass §13 acceptance
- Out of scope: operator wikilink curation of snapshot Related: fields
- Files in scope: knowledge-bases/strategic-os/CLAUDE.md, knowledge-bases/strategic-os/.claude/commands/kb-query.md, knowledge-bases/strategic-os/.claude/commands/kb-integrity.md, knowledge-bases/strategic-os/templates/project-state-note.md (new), knowledge-bases/strategic-os/project-state/_index.md (new), each target project's .claude/settings.json, ai-resources/.claude/commands/refresh-project-state.md (new, graduated), ai-resources/.claude/agents/project-state-snapshot-agent.md (new, graduated), ai-resources/.claude/agents/project-state-scrub-verifier.md (new, graduated), projects/strategic-os/.claude/agents/state-retrieval-agent.md
- Stop if: a GO-gate cannot be satisfied structurally

refresh-project-state Session 2 — land + wire + validate. Satisfy GO-gates G1 (structural Read-deny in target projects), G2 (folder-scoped Write to vault project-state/), G3 (§13 rollback test); scaffold vault project-state/ + template + index; apply §15 governance amendment to all 3 canonical-only sites + vault-identity sentence (operator-approved 2026-06-09); extend /kb-integrity Check D; graduate 3 dev artifacts → ai-resources/.claude/{commands,agents}/; wire OS state-retrieval-agent; end-time /risk-check → dry-run one project → full run → §13 acceptance.

## 2026-06-09 — refresh-project-state Session 2 resume: cleared both commit-block gates, committed (validate-later)

### Summary
Resumed the `refresh-project-state` Session 2 QC-PENDING continuity scratchpad in an ai-resources-rooted session. Ran the two pre-commit gates that were unreachable in the prior session: independent `/qc-pass` (GO, zero findings across 12 files) and end-time `/risk-check` (GO, 4 Mediums / 0 High — no system-owner second opinion required on GO). Empirically confirmed the prior session's load-bearing claim via a live G1 canary probe — wrote a `*confidential*`-named file under `audits/working/` and the Read SUCCEEDED, proving the workspace-root Read-deny does not load in an ai-resources-rooted session, so STOP 3 validation cannot run here. Operator chose "commit now, validate later" (artifacts are inert until the command is run). Committed the change set scoped per repo across 4 repos with explicit-path staging; leftover S4 file and foreign untracked files left untouched. Reframed the scratchpad from QC-PENDING commit-block to VALIDATION-PENDING.

### Files Created
- `audits/risk-checks/2026-06-09-end-time-refresh-project-state-session-2-landing-change-set.md` — end-time risk-check report (GO).

### Files Modified
- Committed (graduation, this session): `.claude/commands/refresh-project-state.md`, `.claude/agents/project-state-snapshot-agent.md`, `.claude/agents/project-state-scrub-verifier.md` (renamed from `workflows/refresh-project-state/...` dev source, which was removed).
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-06-09-12-03-scratchpad.md` — reframed QC-PENDING → VALIDATION-PENDING; recorded both GOs + 4 commit hashes (gitignored).
- Cross-repo commits (see Decisions): workspace-root `.claude/settings.json`; strategic-os `state-retrieval-agent.md` + `docs/project-state-workflow-spec.md`; vault `CLAUDE.md`, `kb-query.md`, `kb-integrity.md`, `_master-index.md`, `project-state/_index.md`, `templates/project-state-note.md`.

### Decisions Made
- **Commit now, validate later (operator).** Both commit-block gates (QC, risk-check) GO; STOP 3 runtime validation deferred to a workspace-root session because the G1 deny only loads there (confirmed live via canary probe). Committed code is inert until the command is run, so deferral carries no confidentiality risk.
- **Commits scoped per repo, explicit-path staging:** ai-resources `017924e`, workspace-root `2bf25a8`, strategic-os `b9f42d7` (spec §14/§13 mechanics correction surfaced in the message per SO directive), vault `833215a`. Excluded the leftover concurrent-S4 file `audits/risk-checks/2026-06-09-promote-research-methodology-deltas-...md` and all foreign untracked files.
- **innovation-registry.md included** in the ai-resources commit — its 3 new rows are all this change set's files (kb-query, kb-integrity, state-retrieval-agent), auto-detected by the hook.

### Risky actions
Committed across 4 repos in an ai-resources-rooted session with known concurrent-session leftovers present — mitigated by explicit-path staging (never `git add -A`/`.`); verified each repo's staged set before commit. Wrote + deleted a live `*confidential*`-named canary probe under `audits/working/` to test the G1 deny (Read succeeded → deny not active here, as predicted). No irreversible or external action; nothing pushed.

### Next Steps
- **Workspace-root session required:** start Claude Code rooted at the workspace root → run `/refresh-project-state` dry-run on one project + full run (STOP 3) → check §13 acceptance criteria 1–6 → delete the `2026-06-09-12-03` scratchpad once §13 passes. QC + risk-check + commit are all done; skip them.
- **Push pending:** 4 repos have unpushed commits (ai-resources, workspace-root, strategic-os, vault) — push gate at this wrap.

### Open Questions
None.

## 2026-06-09 — /prime hardening: dirty-tree autostash + deterministic session-notes read

### Summary
Hardened the `/prime` command against same-day session clutter, prompted by an operator
self-diagnosis of a slow `/prime` run (five same-day sessions left the git tree and
`logs/session-notes.md` cluttered). Scoped the fix inside `/prime` (operator decision) to
tolerate the mess rather than prevent it upstream in `/wrap-session`. Three edits landed,
committed `d7f619c`. Ran concurrently with a separate refresh-project-state Session 2
terminal; foreign-session guard confirmed FOREIGN=0 (that session's content was already in
HEAD). This session ran no `/prime` or `/session-start`, so it carries no own marker — this
note uses a descriptive non-marker header by design.

### Files Created
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-06-09-12-30-scratchpad.md` — continuity scratchpad (work is complete; no resume needed).

### Files Modified
- `.claude/commands/prime.md` — three changes: (1) Step 0 `git pull` → `git pull --rebase --autostash` (both repos); (2) Step 1 deterministic last-entry read (`grep -n "^## [0-9]" | tail -1` → Read offset→EOF); (3) Step 8a/8b/8c header-existence check → `grep -Fxq` with explicit exit-0→reuse / exit-1→create branching.

### Decisions Made
- Scope the fix **inside `/prime`** (harden orientation to tolerate clutter), not upstream in `/wrap-session` — operator.
- Step 0 writes `--rebase --autostash` **explicitly** rather than relying on invisible `pull.rebase` config — system-owner safety review.
- **Leave the batching spec (cause 4) unchanged** — system-owner verdict: execution-time adherence drift, not a spec-content gap; a louder "MUST" is instruction-bloat against a Sonnet orchestrator.
- **Fold the Step 8 sibling-read fix into the same change** (structural-over-patch: fix the defect class once) rather than patching only the Step 1 read — system-owner cross-resource catch.
- No per-day session-notes rotation (out of in-`/prime` scope; touches the archival contract).

### Risky actions
None. The prime.md edit is reversible; no destructive, external, or shared-state-clobber action taken. The concurrent-session collision was detected and cleared by the Step 3.5 guard (FOREIGN=0), not nearly-clobbered.

### Next Steps
- Push the two local commits (prime.md `d7f619c` + this wrap-log commit) at the push gate below.
- **Unverified-at-merge:** Change 1's autostash-pop-conflict path is exercised only by the next `/prime` that starts with a dirty tree. No action unless a future `/prime` reports a pop conflict.

### Open Questions
None.

## 2026-06-09 — Session S2
**Mandate:** Reproduce a dirty-tree + remote-ahead state in an isolated temp git repo and run `git pull --rebase --autostash` (prime.md Step 0), confirming stash→rebase→pop on both a clean-pop and a conflict-pop path — done when: both paths run in the temp repo, behavior recorded, with a one-line verdict on whether Step 0's autostash path behaves as the hardening intended.
- Out of scope: no changes to live ai-resources history or to prime.md; a revealed defect is surfaced, not silently fixed.
- Files in scope: .claude/commands/prime.md (read-only reference); temp-dir test scratch (inferred)
- Stop if: (none stated)
Test the /prime autostash-over-rebase path on a dirty working tree (Change 1 from the 2026-06-09 /prime hardening) — confirm clean-pop and conflict-pop behavior in an isolated test repo.

### Summary
Closed the "Unverified-at-merge" carryover from the 2026-06-09 `/prime` hardening by testing Change 1 (Step 0 `pull --rebase --autostash`) in two throwaway sandbox git repos — never touching live state. The **clean-pop path PASSED** exactly as intended (stash → rebase → pop, dirty edit restored). The **conflict-pop path is data-safe** (local change recoverable from both conflict markers and a retained `stash@{0}`) **but revealed a real `/prime` gap**: a conflicting autostash pop returns **exit code 0**, which Step 0 misclassifies as `updated`, so `/prime` would emit a clean-looking brief while the working tree silently carries conflict markers. Surfaced (not fixed — out of mandate scope) and logged to the improvement-log for the Friday cadence.

### Files Created
- `audits/working/2026-06-09-S2-prime-autostash-path-test.md` — full test findings, both scenarios (gitignored working note; not committed).
- `logs/session-plan-2026-06-09-S2.md` — session plan (auto-mode).
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-06-09-16-38-scratchpad.md` — continuity scratchpad (this wrap).

### Files Modified
- `logs/improvement-log.md` — new PENDING entry: "/prime Step 0 silently swallows an autostash pop conflict (exit 0 misclassified as `updated`)" with a one-block fix proposal.
- `logs/session-notes.md` — this entry (S2 header + mandate + note).

### Decisions Made
- **Bumped this session to marker S2** despite the deterministic rule computing S1 — a foreign `## 2026-06-09 — Session S1` header from an earlier session already existed and the shared `.session-marker` was stale (`2026-06-03`); following the literal exit-0→reuse branch would have contaminated another session's entry.
- **Tested in an isolated temp repo, not the live repo** — avoids manufacturing risky git state in shared history; the autostash mechanics reproduce identically in a sandbox.
- **Surfaced the exit-0 conflict-swallow finding, did not fix it** — it is a `/prime` command-body change needing `/risk-check`; per the mandate's out-of-scope clause, revealed defects are surfaced, not silently fixed. Routed to improvement-log for the Friday cadence.

### Risky actions
None. All git operations ran in throwaway temp repos under the OS temp area; no write to live ai-resources history, no network push during execution, no `prime.md` edit. Two temp sandboxes left for macOS to auto-reclaim (an `rm -rf` was declined at the permission prompt; harmless).

### Next Steps
- Friday cadence: weigh the logged `/prime` Step 0 exit-0 conflict-swallow fix (grep output for `Applying autostash resulted in conflicts` / residual stash / `UU` status → carry a `⚠ Pull:` exception into the Step 6 brief). Run `/risk-check` before editing `prime.md`.

### Open Questions
None.

## 2026-06-09 — Session S3
**Mandate:** Rebase the local unpushed revert `f2b5d6e` onto `origin/main`, resolving the one `logs/improvement-log.md` conflict so both sides survive — the remote S2 `/prime` autostash-pop entry AND `f2b5d6e`'s reversions (Option B + Milestone 4 → DEFERRED; PE-provider + P2/P4 promotion entries removed) — done when: rebase complete, working tree clean (no conflict markers), local HEAD a linear descendant of `origin/main`, and `improvement-log.md` holds both sides' content.
- Out of scope: pushing (gated to wrap); the untracked risk-check file (task #2); the `prime.md` autostash-gap fix (task #3)
- Files in scope: logs/improvement-log.md
- Stop if: the correct merge becomes ambiguous (resolving would drop the remote S2 entry or the local reversion intent)

Reconcile the diverged ai-resources branch — rebase the local revert commit onto origin/main's concurrent S2 commits, resolving the improvement-log.md conflict. Marker bumped to S3 (S2 belongs to the remote machine's session now rebased into HEAD).

## 2026-06-09 — Session S4
Validate refresh-project-state against §13 acceptance criteria: #4 forced-failure atomic rollback, #5 OS read + stale-flag, plus the cheap /kb-integrity Check D extension to project-state/.

### Summary
Ran the deferred STOP-3 acceptance validation for `refresh-project-state` from the workspace root, closing the "validate-later" loop opened in the Session-2 resume. Verified all six §13 acceptance criteria against the already-committed full run (vault `eaa792f`, 14 snapshots). Two criteria were tested empirically rather than by-design: #4 forced-failure atomic rollback (scratch reproduction of Step 4 write-temp-then-rename — all three cases pass) and #5 OS stale-detection (live data: 13 fresh + 1 correctly STALE). Found the `/kb-integrity` Check D project-state/ extension already landed. Command is acceptance-complete.

### Files Created
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-06-09-19-45-scratchpad.md` — continuity scratchpad (validation closure record)

### Files Modified
- `logs/decisions.md` — S4 acceptance-closure entry + already-landed Check D note + parked forward items (committed `df53cb0`)
- `logs/session-notes.md` — S4 entry (this note); also committed an orphan S3 header left uncommitted by the prior session

### Decisions Made
- All six §13 acceptance criteria validated; the "validate-later" deferral is closed. (logged to decisions.md)
- #4 rollback proven at the mechanism level (scratch reproduction); honest caveat recorded — not fault-injection into a live LLM run; adherence is by prompt-instruction (Step 4 read and confirmed).
- Check D extension found already landed — no action.
- Forward items (PreToolUse write/read hook; cadence automation §11) stay parked for separate sessions.

### Risky actions
None. The #4 rollback test ran entirely in a throwaway mktemp dir; the #5 stale check was read-only; the real vault was never touched. Committed only my two log files by explicit path, leaving pre-existing foreign-dirty files (prime.md et al.) untouched.

### Next Steps
- refresh-project-state is done — no pending work. If extending it later: (1) path-aware PreToolUse write/read hook (own `/risk-check`), (2) cadence automation (§11). Each is its own session.

### Open Questions
None.

## 2026-06-09 — Session S3 wrap: branch reconcile, /prime autostash fix, concurrent-session fix plan

### Summary
Primed S3 and ran the three `/prime` menu tasks plus an operator-requested fix plan. Reconciled a diverged `ai-resources` branch (rebased the local revert onto `origin/main`, resolving an `improvement-log.md` conflict so both sides survived), committed an orphaned promotion risk-check report as kept prep, implemented + risk-check-GO'd + QC-GO'd a `/prime` Step 0 autostash-pop-conflict detection fix, and wrote a plan-only design for permanently fixing concurrent-session collisions. A concurrent **S4** session ran in this SAME checkout throughout, causing real-time commit entanglement (all content preserved; deliberately not disentangled).

### Files Created
- `audits/2026-06-09-concurrent-session-isolation-fix-plan.md` — plan-only design (4 gated fixes + build order) for concurrent-session isolation. `/qc-pass` GO. (Landed in commit `ebe7301` — swept there by the concurrent S4 commit; content intact.)
- `audits/risk-checks/2026-06-09-harden-prime-claude-commands-prime-md-step-0-pull-result.md` — `/risk-check` report (GO) for the prime.md fix. (Committed in `8691388`.)
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-06-09-19-55-scratchpad.md` — continuity scratchpad.

### Files Modified
- `.claude/commands/prime.md` — Step 0 autostash-pop-conflict detection (detect-first multi-signal OR → `autostash-conflict` state) + Step 4 carry + Step 6 brief exception line. (`8691388`)
- `logs/improvement-log.md` — reconciled in the rebase (`df28eda`); flipped the autostash-pop entry to RESOLVED (`8691388`).
- `audits/risk-checks/2026-06-09-promote-research-methodology-deltas-to-canonical-workflow-template.md` — committed as kept prep. (`49c5eb3`)

### Decisions Made
- **Reconcile the diverged branch by rebase, keeping both sides** — the remote S2 autostash entry AND the local reversions; resolved the one `improvement-log.md` conflict by hand. Source: operator (task #1 auto-mode).
- **Commit the orphaned promotion risk-check report as kept prep, not delete** — paired with the deliberately-kept manifest; risk-check reports are retained audit artifacts; commit message warns to re-run at the actual end-of-project promotion. Source: Claude judgment (decision-point posture), task #2.
- **`/prime` autostash fix = WORTH-DOING** — silent degradation in the highest-traffic command; trigger conditions occur in this multi-session workspace; cheap additive fix. Gated by `/risk-check` (GO) + `/qc-pass` (GO). Source: task #3.
- **Concurrent-session plan = automate/enforce the existing playbook, not rewrite it** — `parallel-sessions-playbook.md` + worktree commands already exist but are advisory/opt-in; the gap is adherence/automation. Source: operator request + sibling-redundancy check.
- **Do NOT disentangle the mixed S3/S4 commit history** — rewriting shared history while a concurrent session commits is dangerous; all content is preserved, only attribution is mixed. Source: Claude judgment.

### Outcome
COMPLETION: DELIVERED
EXECUTION: ACCEPTABLE
- What was asked but not done: none — all three `/prime` tasks + the plan delivered as claimed (independently verified against git: HEAD linear 7-ahead/0-behind, `prime.md` carries the 4 edit points, both audit files exist, improvement-log entry flipped to RESOLVED, commits df28eda/49c5eb3/8691388 match).
- Better path: the shared-checkout concurrent run caused an avoidable rework loop (a foreign commit carried this session's fix-plan + notes; recovery cost extra commits). The cleaner path was the workspace's own rule — `/clear` or a separate worktree per session (parallel-sessions-playbook) — i.e., exactly what this session's fix-plan now targets.
- Confidence: high

### Risky actions
Two near-misses, both from the same-checkout concurrent session sharing one staging index: (1) my `git commit --amend` swept the concurrent session's staged `claim-permission.template.md` into my commit — caught via post-commit `--stat`, corrected by soft-reset + unstage + recommit, foreign change preserved in the working tree; (2) the concurrent S4 commit (`ebe7301`) swept my staged fix-plan file and S3 mandate into ITS commits — detected, content verified preserved, not disentangled. No data lost. This is the live instance of the #1 anti-pattern the new fix-plan addresses.

### Session Assessment (wrap-collector, 2026-06-09)
- Autonomy-compounding: no new signal (autostash fix already implemented + RESOLVED this session; concurrent-session fix is plan-only with a confirmed consumer).
- Leanness/cost: no signal (autostash fix cheap-additive; mixed S3/S4 commit attribution is deliberate churn, correctly left undisentangled).
- Principle-drift: no signal.
- Friction: process — same-checkout concurrent S3/S4 sharing one staging index caused two commit-entanglement events; logged to friction-log.
- Safety: HIGH — a `git commit --amend` swept a foreign staged file and a foreign commit later swept this session's staged files; shared-staging-index clobbers actually occurred (no data lost, corrected/verified). First instance where the staging index (not just shared logs) was the clobber surface. Fix is plan-only: `audits/2026-06-09-concurrent-session-isolation-fix-plan.md` (build-order step 1 = staging-index guard).
- Routed: 0→improvement-log (both items deduped against existing entries), 1→friction-log.

### Next Steps
- Decide the promotion-vs-rollback question: S4 committed the promotion (`da72d7a`) that was rolled back earlier today as premature — keep or revert (operator's call).
- Push the 6 unpushed commits via the gated confirmation.
- Later (separate session): execute the concurrent-session isolation fix-plan (build order: staging-index guard → block same-checkout → wrap-owns-logs → default worktree launch → per-session log namespacing). Each fix runs its own `/risk-check`.

### Open Questions
- Was the S4 promotion (`da72d7a`) intended, or are the two sessions at cross-purposes? Unresolved — operator's call.

## 2026-06-09 — Session S5
**Mandate:** Implement Fix 2 of the concurrent-session isolation fix-plan — a PreToolUse(Bash) guard that inspects the staging index for files outside the session's declared footprint before git commit / git commit --amend / git add -A and pauses showing the foreign files — done when: the guard hook is implemented, wired into settings.json, passes /risk-check (GO) and /qc-pass (GO), and is committed
- Out of scope: Fixes 1/3/4 of the same plan; the concurrent S4 session's in-flight work (da72d7a, claim-permission.template.md, the untracked promotion risk-check file); the promotion-vs-rollback decision
- Files in scope: .claude/hooks/check-foreign-staging.sh, .claude/settings.json, docs/commit-discipline.md, docs/session-marker.md
- Stop if: /risk-check returns NO-GO or RECONSIDER, or the sanction check reveals Fix 2 was deliberately parked rather than sanctioned
- Allowed inputs: audits/2026-06-09-concurrent-session-isolation-fix-plan.md, .claude/hooks/check-heavy-tool.sh, .claude/hooks/detect-concurrent-session.sh, .claude/commands/concurrent-session-check.md, docs/parallel-sessions-playbook.md
- Required outputs: .claude/hooks/check-foreign-staging.sh
- Context pack: output/context-packs/hook-20260609-7c2a1/pack.md

Execute Fix 2 of the concurrent-session isolation fix-plan — the staging-index guard (a `PreToolUse(Bash)` guard that inspects the staging index for files outside the session's declared footprint before `git commit` / `git commit --amend` / `git add -A`). Source: `audits/2026-06-09-concurrent-session-isolation-fix-plan.md` build-order step 1.

### Summary
Built Fix 2 (build-order step 1) of the concurrent-session isolation fix-plan: `check-foreign-staging.sh`, a `PreToolUse(Bash)` staging tripwire that blocks (exit 2, model-facing) a gated git verb when it would stage a file outside this session's declared footprint and not on the exempt-list, and fails open when no concrete footprint exists. Full chain ran: `/prime` task 3 → `/session-start` (context-discovery pack: insufficient-to-implement, surfaced 3 design questions) → `/session-plan` → plan-time `/risk-check` (PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION, 4 mitigations applied, system-owner concurred) → build → `/qc-pass` (REVISE → 3 fixes → verification re-QC GO) → committed `f5e013c`. 17 dry-run cases green; the hook passed its first live test on its own landing commit. A wrap-time dogfood catch then surfaced one exempt-list gap — log-rotation archive files (`session-notes-archive-*.md` etc.) were not exempt, which would have false-blocked this very wrap commit when Step 3 auto-archived; fixed (hook + doc) and regression-tested (3 cases) before the wrap commit. Also: the wrap `session-feedback-collector` subagent destructively overwrote `improvement-log.md` — caught, restored losslessly from HEAD, signal re-appended by hand (see Friction).

### Files Created
- `.claude/hooks/check-foreign-staging.sh` — the foreign-staging tripwire hook. (`f5e013c`)
- `audits/risk-checks/2026-06-09-add-pretooluse-bash-hook-check-foreign-staging-fix-2-concurr.md` — `/risk-check` report (PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION) + system-owner Architectural Commentary. (`f5e013c`)
- `logs/session-plan-2026-06-09-S5.md` — the session plan. (`f5e013c`)
- `output/context-packs/hook-20260609-7c2a1/pack.md` — context-discovery pack (untracked, gitignored).
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-06-09-21-30-scratchpad.md` — continuity scratchpad.

### Files Modified
- `.claude/settings.json` — new `"matcher":"Bash"` PreToolUse object wiring the hook (timeout 5; no `model` field). (`f5e013c`)
- `docs/commit-discipline.md` — new "Foreign-staging tripwire" subsection. (`f5e013c`)
- `logs/session-notes-archive-2026-06.md` — archive auto-triggered at wrap (11 entries archived, 10 kept).

### Decisions Made
- **exit-2-to-model block mechanism, not a permissionDecision ask/deny prompt** — respects the zero-permission-prompt / `bypassPermissions` floor; advisory tripwire (OP-5), not enforcement. Source: Claude design + system-owner concur.
- **Exempt-list = append-only shared logs + own `logs/` byproducts + write-once `audits/risk-checks/` + `audits/working/`** — guard targets edit-in-place content files; also resolves the self-block bootstrapping (hook goes live on its own landing commit). Source: Claude design.
- **Skipped the session-start.md + session-marker.md edits** — system-owner rejected reviewer mitigation #2 (the hook fails open on a label rename, so it is not a parse-contract reader). Source: system-owner.
- **End-time `/risk-check` skipped** — plan-time gate covered the full design with all mitigations applied + verified; QC fixes added no new structural surface; drift bounded; commit shipped. Per the documented end-time-skip rule.
- QC fixes (separate from operator-directed decisions): footprint repo-name prefix-strip; `git add -u` untracked over-count + `cd X && git add .` subdir scoping; `./pathspec` mis-gating.
- **Wrap-time dogfood fix (post-commit, in this wrap commit):** added log-rotation archive files (`logs/*archive*.md`) to the hook's exempt-list — the auto-archive at wrap Step 3 produced `session-notes-archive-2026-06.md`, which was neither in-footprint nor exempt and would have false-blocked this wrap commit. Strictly safe-direction (only widens exemption); regression-tested. Hook + commit-discipline.md re-edited (both in-footprint).

### Outcome
COMPLETION: DELIVERED
EXECUTION: OPTIMAL
- What was asked but not done: none. All four done-when conditions verified on disk (hook 292 lines, `bash -n` clean; wired into settings.json PreToolUse as a `"matcher":"Bash"` object, timeout 5; risk-check report present; 3 QC REVISE fixes traceable in-code; committed `f5e013c`; commit-discipline.md subsection substantive). `docs/session-marker.md` left unedited is gate-sanctioned (risk-check Architectural Commentary (c): "needs no edit"), not a miss.
- Better path: none. The "/risk-check (GO)" done-when was legitimately satisfied by PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION with all four mitigations applied; treating reviewer mit #2 as "reject per system-owner" correctly followed the gate's ruling over the mandate's file list; end-time-risk-check skip was within the documented rule.
- Confidence: high (independent outcome check, 2026-06-09)

### Risky actions
None irreversible. Two near-relevant notes: (1) the hook went live in `settings.json` mid-session and evaluated this session's own landing commit — by design; it passed (all staged files footprint+exempt). (2) S4's two foreign files (`claim-permission.template.md` modified, the untracked promote-3 risk-check file) remained in the working tree throughout; staged explicitly (never `git add -A`) so they were not swept into `f5e013c`. The new tripwire would itself have blocked such a sweep.

### Session Assessment (wrap-collector, 2026-06-09 — partial; collector crashed mid-write, see Friction)
- Autonomy-compounding: reusable artifact — first blocking `PreToolUse(Bash)` hook in the repo (`check-foreign-staging.sh`), a generalizable staging-tripwire pattern + a commit-discipline doc contract. Candidate for `/innovation-sweep`.
- Leanness/cost: no signal — verb-gated early-exit (exits 0 before any read on non-git Bash), timeout 5, no always-loaded weight added.
- Principle-drift: no signal — design respected OP-5 (advisory not enforcement), OP-3 (loud stop path), the bypassPermissions floor; end-time risk-check skip followed the documented rule.
- Friction: **PROCESS-SAFETY (HIGH) — the wrap `session-feedback-collector` subagent destructively overwrote `logs/improvement-log.md` with the literal text "placeholder" (a `Write` where an append was intended).** Caught immediately; restored losslessly from HEAD via `git restore --source=HEAD` (the file was clean == HEAD at session start, confirmed by the `/prime` FOREIGN_SHARED check). The one genuine signal the collector intended was then re-appended by hand. Routed to friction-log for collector hardening.
- Safety: (a) the fail-open latent gap in the new hook (footprint-less sessions get no protection) — logged to improvement-log as a low-severity guardrail-candidate. (b) root-cause concurrency gap this hook closes was already logged active — deduped, not re-logged. (c) hook went live mid-session and evaluated its own landing commit — passed by design (exempt-list bootstrapping); near-miss caught, no gap.
- Routed: 1→improvement-log (fail-open guardrail-candidate, manually re-appended after the incident), 1→friction-log (collector write incident).

### Next Steps
- Build **Fix 1** (block same-checkout concurrency — upgrade `detect-concurrent-session.sh` to a blocking SessionStart decision) in a fresh session. Build order continues: Fix 1 → Fix 4(a) wrap-owns logs → Fix 3 default worktree → Fix 4(b) per-session log namespacing.
- Decide the promotion-vs-rollback question on `da72d7a` (carryover from S3 — operator's call).
- Push the unpushed commits (gated confirmation at this wrap).

### Open Questions
- Promotion-vs-rollback on `da72d7a` (S4's research-workflow canonical promotion) — keep or revert? Unresolved, operator's call.

## 2026-06-10 — Session S1
**Mandate:** RE-SCOPED (operator-approved 2026-06-10): SessionStart hooks cannot block (verified vs Claude Code docs — exit 2 shows stderr but the session continues), so Fix 1's "forceful block" premise is not buildable. Re-scoped to a soft precision-fix — keep `detect-concurrent-session.sh` non-blocking (exit 0), tighten the same-checkout SHARP nudge so it stops false-firing on the operator's own already-wrapped session by making the per-id marker set a liveness signal (`/wrap-session` removes its per-id marker at teardown; the hook counts un-wrapped foreign per-id markers in THIS checkout), re-sync the two byte-identical project copies, and update the two-end contract docs — done when: the hook's liveness-based same-checkout discriminator + legacy fallback is implemented, both project copies re-synced, `/wrap-session` per-id teardown added, `docs/session-marker.md` registry updated, `/qc-pass` GO, and committed
- Out of scope: Fixes 2/3/4 of the same plan (Fix 2 already shipped); the two untouched S4 foreign files (`claim-permission.template.md`, the untracked promote-3 risk-check file); the da72d7a promotion-vs-rollback decision; the precise lsof/cwd discriminator (deliberately deferred by the hook author as brittle)
- Files in scope: .claude/hooks/detect-concurrent-session.sh, projects/positioning-research/.claude/hooks/detect-concurrent-session.sh, projects/research-pe-regime-shift-advisory-gap/.claude/hooks/detect-concurrent-session.sh, .claude/commands/wrap-session.md, docs/session-marker.md, docs/parallel-sessions-playbook.md (inferred)
- Stop if: /risk-check returns NO-GO or RECONSIDER (resolved: PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION, re-scoped per operator after the SessionStart-can't-block finding fired this very Stop-if; mitigations applied)

Build Fix 1 of the concurrent-session isolation fix-plan — upgrade `detect-concurrent-session.sh` to a blocking SessionStart decision when the same checkout is already in use.

### Summary
Built **Fix 1** of the concurrent-session isolation fix-plan, but RE-SCOPED mid-session (operator-approved) from the planned "forceful SessionStart block" to a **soft precision-fix**. An authoritative Claude Code hooks-docs check (claude-code-guide), confirmed by `/risk-check` (PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION) and a system-owner second opinion, established that a SessionStart hook **cannot block** a session — exit 2 only shows stderr; the session continues. The block premise was therefore not buildable (the mandate's Stop-if fired). The shipped change instead removes the same-checkout nudge's false-fire on the operator's own already-wrapped same-day session: the sharp nudge is now keyed on the count of **un-wrapped foreign per-id markers** (a liveness signal) rather than the date-pruned shared marker, completed by a new `/wrap-session` Step 13 that deletes the session's per-id marker at teardown. 7 dry-run scenarios pass; QC APPROVE. 3 commits across 3 repos.

### Files Created
- `logs/session-plan-2026-06-10-S1.md` — the session plan. (`93c6cdc`)
- `audits/risk-checks/2026-06-10-upgrade-detect-concurrent-session-sh-fix-1-same-checkout-block.md` — `/risk-check` report (PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION) + system-owner Architectural Commentary + the two empirical resolutions (SessionStart-can't-block; 2 byte-identical project copies confirmed). (`93c6cdc`)
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-06-10-10-30-scratchpad.md` — continuity scratchpad.

### Files Modified
- `.claude/hooks/detect-concurrent-session.sh` — same-checkout SHARP/SOFT decision rewritten to the per-id liveness discriminator (oracle path) + legacy old-CLI fallback; header rewritten with the liveness + why-only-a-nudge sections. Still non-blocking. (`93c6cdc`)
- `.claude/commands/wrap-session.md` — new Step 13 per-id marker teardown (final wrap action). (`93c6cdc`)

- `projects/research-pe-regime-shift-advisory-gap/.claude/hooks/detect-concurrent-session.sh` — byte-identical re-sync. (`2e738e7`, separate repo)

### Decisions Made
- **Re-scope Fix 1 from "forceful block" to "soft precision-fix"** (operator-approved via AskUserQuestion) — a SessionStart hook cannot block (verified vs docs); the block premise was not buildable. Enforcement of the dangerous move (cross-session commit) stays with Fix 2's PreToolUse tripwire. Source: operator decision after the Stop-if fired.
- **Liveness via per-id marker + wrap-teardown, NOT a new state file or lsof/cwd** — reuses the existing per-id markers; `/wrap-session` Step 13 deletes the session's own at teardown so the per-id set means "un-wrapped ≈ live." The precise lsof/cwd detector stays deferred (the hook author's deliberate call). Source: Claude design, QC-confirmed.
- **Oracle-vs-old-CLI fallback boundary = `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` unset** (not "no per-id markers") — caught during dry-run testing: keying the fallback on marker-absence re-introduced the exact solo-reopen false-fire (own wrapped → 0 per-id markers → legacy SHARP). Scoped the legacy heuristic to genuine old-CLI only. Source: Claude (self-caught test failure).

### Outcome
COMPLETION: DELIVERED
EXECUTION: OPTIMAL
- What was asked but not done: none. Independent outcome check (general-purpose, fresh context, 2026-06-10) verified all four claims against reality: hook non-blocking (every path exit 0) with the per-id liveness discriminator + `[ -z CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID ]` old-CLI fallback boundary; wrap-session Step 13 teardown final + per-id-only; three hook copies byte-identical (diff clean); all three commits (93c6cdc, 5e0e0f9, 2e738e7) present with claimed contents.
- Better path: none. The mid-session re-scope was the correct response to the not-buildable block premise (surfaced, operator-approved), not a detour.
- Confidence: high.

### Risky actions
None irreversible. Note: the new `/wrap-session` Step 13 teardown runs for the FIRST time on THIS wrap (dogfood) — it removes only this session's own per-id marker, after all marker-dependent steps. The two pre-existing S4 foreign files remained untouched in the working tree throughout and were never staged (explicit-path commits; the Fix 2 tripwire would have blocked a sweep). **Wrap incident:** the `session-feedback-collector` subagent (Step 6.5) destructively overwrote `logs/friction-log.md` via a whole-file `Write` (truncated to 1 line) + created a stray `.append-marker-tmp` — a SECOND occurrence of the S5 collector hazard (S5 hit improvement-log.md). Caught by the subagent itself; restored losslessly from HEAD (`git restore --source=HEAD`); stray file removed; both intended signals re-appended by hand; collector-hardening escalated to a medium improvement-log entry.

### Session Assessment (wrap-collector, 2026-06-10 — reconstructed by main session after the collector's write incident)
- Autonomy-compounding: Fix 1 is an evolution of an existing fix-plan consumer (`detect-concurrent-session.sh`), not a novel reusable component — no `/innovation-sweep` nudge.
- Leanness/cost: no signal — clean re-scope, no churn, no always-loaded weight added.
- Principle-drift: no signal — the re-scope respected the bypassPermissions / zero-prompt floor, OP-12 (closure before detection: Fix 2 already blocks the dangerous move), and the hook author's lsof/cwd deferral.
- Friction: two entries hand-routed to friction-log (process-safety: collector destructive-overwrite RECURRENCE; process/spec: fix-plan baked an un-buildable SessionStart-block premise caught only at build time).
- Safety: two guardrail-candidates routed to improvement-log — (low) workspace-root wrap-session.md lacks the Step 13 teardown port; (medium) session-feedback-collector destructive-Write recurrence → harden to append-only.
- Routed: 2→friction-log, 2→improvement-log (all hand-appended after the collector incident; collector wrote nothing).

### Next Steps
- Build **Fix 4(a)** (wrap-owns shared-log discipline) — next in the isolation fix-plan build order (Fix 2 ✓ → Fix 1 ✓ → Fix 4(a) → Fix 3 → Fix 4(b)). Source: `audits/2026-06-09-concurrent-session-isolation-fix-plan.md`.
- **Port the `/wrap-session` Step 13 per-id teardown to the workspace-root `.claude/commands/wrap-session.md` copy** (flagged in-code via MIRROR NOTE) — its sessions otherwise won't clean up per-id markers, degrading the new liveness signal at workspace-root.
- Decide the **promotion-vs-rollback** question on `da72d7a` (carryover from S3/S5 — operator's call).
- Push the unpushed commits (gated confirmation at this wrap).

### Open Questions
- Promotion-vs-rollback on `da72d7a` (S4's research-workflow canonical promotion) — keep or revert? Unresolved, operator's call.

## 2026-06-10 — Session S2
**Mandate:** Establish the "wrap-owns" discipline for the in-place mutations of the shared logs (improvement-log.md, decisions.md) in docs/commit-discipline.md, so concurrent sessions serialize on those logs instead of colliding — done when: the wrap-owns rule is documented in commit-discipline.md, the append-vs-in-place doc-classification conflict is reconciled, legitimate non-wrap appenders are explicitly carved out, /risk-check GO, /qc-pass clean, committed
- Out of scope: Fix 3, Fix 4(b) per-session namespacing; the da72d7a promotion-vs-rollback decision; the two untouched S4 foreign files; carryover task #2 (porting wrap-session Step 13 to the workspace-root copy)
- Files in scope: docs/commit-discipline.md, .claude/commands/wrap-session.md, .claude/commands/improve.md, .claude/commands/resolve-improvement-log.md, docs/parallel-sessions-playbook.md (inferred)
- Stop if: /risk-check returns NO-GO or RECONSIDER
- Context pack: output/context-packs/documentation-20260610-f3a9c/pack.md

Build Fix 4(a) of the concurrent-session isolation fix-plan — wrap-owns shared-log discipline for the non-append logs (improvement-log.md, decisions.md).

### Summary
Built **Fix 4(a)** of the concurrent-session isolation fix-plan: added a "Maintenance-owned in-place mutations" rule to `docs/commit-discipline.md` codifying that the shared status logs (`improvement-log.md`, `friction-log.md`) may be **appended** by ordinary work sessions but only **mutated in place** (status flips, archiving) by dedicated single-purpose sessions — the Friday maintenance cadence and `/fix-repo-issues` plan execution. Reconciled an internal contradiction in `commit-discipline.md` itself (the foreign-staging exempt-list called these logs "append-only/benign" while § Shared-log write-path integrity called them "non-append/lost-update hazard" — both right about different operations). Picked via `/prime 1 auto`; risk-check GO; QC REVISE→APPROVE. 1 commit.

### Files Created
- `audits/risk-checks/2026-06-10-add-maintenance-owned-in-place-mutations-rule-fix-4a.md` — `/risk-check` report (GO, all six dimensions Low). (`9976a6b`)
- `logs/session-plan-2026-06-10-S2.md` — the session plan.
- `logs/scratchpads/2026-06-10-14-30-scratchpad.md` — continuity scratchpad.

### Files Modified
- `docs/commit-discipline.md` — NEW section "## Maintenance-owned in-place mutations (shared-log serialization)"; scoping clause added to the foreign-staging tripwire exempt-list paragraph (reconciles the L25/L29 contradiction). (`9976a6b`)
- `docs/parallel-sessions-playbook.md` — one new row in the § 2 file-shape classification table (append-shaped-with-in-place-mutations), cross-referencing the new rule. No rewrite (fix-plan §5). (`9976a6b`)
- `logs/session-notes.md` — mandate line + this wrap note.

### Decisions Made
- **Reconcile the append-vs-in-place classification as two operation classes on the same files** — the exempt-list's "append-only/benign" and the write-path-integrity section's "non-append/hazard" both hold, for the append vs in-place-mutation operations respectively. Source: Claude design, grounded in the context-engine conflict flag + the three docs.
- **Frame the rule as "dedicated single-purpose sessions," not "maintenance-cadence only"** — QC pass 1 caught `/fix-repo-issues` plan execution as a mid-session in-place mutator outside the Friday cadence, falsifying the narrower claim. Broadened to "dedicated single-purpose sessions" (maintenance cadence + fix-execution), which keeps the invariant TRUE. Source: QC REVISE finding, resolved by Claude.
- **No command edits** — the invariant already holds (Stage 0 investigation: all in-place mutators are already dedicated-session commands; all mid-session writers append-only with the existing integrity guard). The rule is a guardrail against future drift, not a behavior change. Source: Claude design.

### Outcome
COMPLETION: DELIVERED
EXECUTION: OPTIMAL
- What was asked but not done: none. Independent outcome check (general-purpose, fresh context, 2026-06-10) verified every mandate element against the actual files: wrap-owns rule present (commit-discipline.md new section), L25/L29 contradiction reconciled via the two-class table, legitimate appenders carved out, /risk-check GO file confirmed, QC REVISE→APPROVE corroborated by the /fix-repo-issues mutator now listed, single commit 9976a6b at top of log.
- Refinement assessed sound: the mandate paired "improvement-log.md, decisions.md" but the shipped rule covers improvement-log.md + friction-log.md and carves decisions.md out as append-only (no in-place status-flip writer exists for it). The outcome check ruled this a defensible evidence-led refinement, not a miss — decisions.md is covered if ever archived.
- Better path: none. Confidence: high.

### Risky actions
None irreversible. The two S4 foreign files (`workflows/research-workflow/reference/claim-permission.template.md` modified, `audits/risk-checks/2026-06-09-promote-3-...md` untracked) remained untouched in the working tree throughout and were never staged (explicit-path commit `9976a6b`). Foreign-session pre-write guard ran at wrap: FOREIGN=0 (no concurrent content).

### Session Assessment (wrap-collector, 2026-06-10 — S2)
- Autonomy-compounding: no signal — Fix 4(a) codifies the already-logged wrap-owns shared-log discipline (improvement-log L413), an existing backlog item, not a novel reusable component.
- Leanness/cost: no signal — 1 commit, no churn, no always-loaded weight; doc-only change adds no hook/CLAUDE.md load.
- Principle-drift: no signal — reconciled the commit-discipline.md L25/L29 internal contradiction (single-source spirit upheld); no strained principle.
- Friction: no signal — no collector incident this session (contrast S5/S1), FOREIGN=0 at wrap, explicit-path commit. The QC REVISE→APPROVE was a normal in-loop QC catch, not operator intervention.
- Safety: none observed — `### Risky actions` = none irreversible; two S4 foreign files left untouched/unstaged; pre-write guard clean.
- Routed: 0→improvement-log, 0→friction-log. Not logged (per-session cap): none.
- Note: S2's deliverable *resolves* the active improvement-log wrap-owns sub-point (L413); the collector did not flip that entry's status (Friday-cadence / `/improve` work, outside collector scope).

### Next Steps
- Build **Fix 3** (make worktree-launch the default for a second session) — next in the isolation fix-plan build order (Fix 2 ✓ → Fix 1 ✓ → Fix 4(a) ✓ → Fix 3 → Fix 4(b)). Source: `audits/2026-06-09-concurrent-session-isolation-fix-plan.md`.
- **Port the `/wrap-session` Step 13 per-id teardown to the workspace-root `.claude/commands/wrap-session.md` copy** (S1 carryover, flagged in-code via MIRROR NOTE).
- Decide the **promotion-vs-rollback** question on `da72d7a` (carryover from S3/S5/S1 — operator's call).
- Push the unpushed commits (gated confirmation at this wrap).

### Open Questions
- Promotion-vs-rollback on `da72d7a` (S4's research-workflow canonical promotion) — keep or revert? Unresolved, operator's call.
