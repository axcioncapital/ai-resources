### 2026-05-08 | Wasteful

**Task:** Weekly /friday-checkup across 5 scopes (ai-resources, workspace, axcion-ai-system-owner, global-macro-analysis, repo-documentation), including /audit-repo, /improve, /coach, /permission-sweep --dry-run, W2.1/W2.3/kb-integrity for repo-documentation, consolidated report, and /wrap-session.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | ~30 |
| Files read | ~18 (re-reads: 3) |
| Files written/edited | 17 |
| Tool calls | ~110 |
| Subagents | 12 |
| Rework cycles | 0 |

**Findings:**
- [Coaching return bloat — MAJOR — recurring] 5 collaboration-coach agents each returned 80–100 lines of full analysis (~6–8k tokens) to main session; main session wrote compact 15-line entries to disk. Pattern flagged in 2026-05-01 log as "wire coach to write to disk and return summary." Third consecutive session where this fires unresolved. Estimated waste: ~5–7k tokens per session.
- [Subagent volume — MAJOR] 12 subagents totaling ~590k estimated tokens — largest session on record. repo-health-analyzer alone consumed ~116k with 7 internal sub-sub-agents. No waste within individual agents, but aggregate context load is the ceiling constraint.
- [Parallel coaching returns — MODERATE] 4 coaching agents ran in background in parallel, but all 4 full returns still loaded into main context simultaneously. Parallelism benefits wall-clock only; token load is unchanged. 4 parallel returns worse than 4 sequential with incremental disk-write.
- [Re-reads — Minor] session-notes.md ×2, coaching-log.md ×2, improvement-log.md ×2 — tail-then-full pattern. Low volume, no structural change needed.

Regression from last 3 entries (all Acceptable) — first Wasteful rating. Two MAJOR findings driven by recurring unresolved coaching-return pattern and session scale.

**Recommendation:** Implement the 2026-05-01 recommendation: wire collaboration-coach to write full analysis to a working-notes file on disk and return only a ≤20-line summary to the main session. Third session the pattern fires unresolved; eliminates the single largest recurring waste category.

**Estimated savings:** ~6k tokens/session × 10 sessions = ~60k tokens. Derivation: 5 agents × 90-line return × ~13 tokens/line ≈ 5,850 tokens recovered per checkup.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
1. **repo-health-analyzer scope gate (~350k/month):** Add monthly-only tier gate — skip on weekly unless drift flag set. Saves ~116k tokens × 3 weekly runs between monthly checkups. Largest single lever by volume.
2. **Coaching disk-write contract (~6k/session):** Same fix as primary recommendation — change coach SKILL.md to require working_notes_path write + ≤20-line return. One-time edit; fires every checkup.
3. **Parallel-to-sequential coaching swap (~3.5k peak):** Run coaching agents sequentially with immediate disk-write after each return rather than batching all returns simultaneously. Reduces peak main-session context by ~3 agents × 90 lines.
4. **Findings-extractor inline (~15k one-shot):** Replace with targeted grep/Read over already-written disk artifacts (permission-sweep notes, repo-health report) when those exist. Saves ~15k tokens per checkup.

### 2026-05-05 | Acceptable

**Task:** Designed a weekly Monday + Friday maintenance cadence plan through four iterations (v1–v4), with two QC passes (both REVISE) and one triage pass. Final plan committed to `ai-resources/docs/weekly-cadence.md`.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | ~20 |
| Files read | ~20 (re-reads: 2 — session-notes.md tail ×2, improvement-log.md grep ×2) |
| Files written/edited | 4 |
| Tool calls | ~40 |
| Subagents | 3 |
| Rework cycles | 3 (v1→v2→v3 in-context; v4 first disk write) |

**Findings:**
- **Context bloat — Moderate:** Three large command files (friday-checkup.md ~5k tokens, permission-sweep.md ~4k tokens, friday-act.md ~3k tokens) read in full for orientation; ~12k tokens total, with much of the content not directly cited in the final output. Targeted section reads or grep-then-read would have sufficed for reference use.
- **Rework — Moderate:** Three full plan rewrites occurred in context before first disk write (~150–200 lines each, ~2k tokens/version). Operator feedback and QC findings drove the iteration — not speculative — but keeping v1–v3 in conversation rather than writing drafts to disk inflated context continuously.
- **Re-reads — Minor:** session-notes.md tail read twice (pre-append + post-archive check); improvement-log.md grepped twice (apply check + verify check). Low token cost individually, recurring pattern.

Compared to the last three entries (all Acceptable), this session holds the same rating — no regression, no improvement. The rework pattern is new but was operator-driven rather than a discipline gap.

**Recommendation:** For plan-drafting sessions with expected iteration, write v1 to disk immediately and use Edit operations for subsequent versions rather than regenerating full plan text in context. Converts in-context rework cost (~2k tokens/cycle × 3 cycles) to cheap file edits.

**Estimated savings:** ~4–6k tokens per plan-drafting session (~2k tokens × 2 avoided in-context rewrites). Over 10–20 such sessions: 40–120k tokens.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
1. **Targeted reads on large command files (~8–10k tokens/session):** For orientation reads of files >200 lines, grep for section headers first, then read only the relevant sections. friday-checkup.md and permission-sweep.md alone account for ~9k tokens that could be halved.
2. **Batch improvement-log.md checks into one grep (~200 tokens/session):** Apply-check and verify-check grep calls can be collapsed into a single call — minor but a recurring two-call pattern.
3. **session-notes.md post-archive re-read (~100 tokens/session):** Skip the post-archive tail read; the archive script's exit code is sufficient confirmation.

### 2026-05-01 | Acceptable

**Task:** Monthly Friday checkup across ai-resources (full monthly tier), repo-documentation and obsidian-pe-kb (coach only; improve/audit-repo auto-skipped), and knowledge-bases (all checks auto-skipped). Pre-session: 1-line edit to session-rituals.md to add /session-plan.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | ~35 |
| Files read | ~14 (re-reads: 1 — session-notes.md tail read twice) |
| Files written/edited | 16 (12 new, 4 modified) |
| Tool calls | ~90 |
| Subagents | 8 |
| Rework cycles | 0 |

**Findings:**
- **Context bloat — Moderate (recurring):** /coach pattern fired 3 times; each invocation returned ~100 lines of full coaching analysis to the main session (~300 lines total / ~4k tokens), all distilled to 15-line compact disk entries. Same pattern flagged on 2026-04-24 — second occurrence in the log. Pattern is structural: /coach is not yet wired to write notes-to-disk before returning to main session.
- **Context bloat — Minor:** token-audit-protocol.md read in full (633 lines / ~8k tokens) — protocol-mandated, recurring each token-audit run. No enforcement mechanism prevents a full read on subsequent sessions where protocol is unchanged.
- **Context bloat — Minor:** token-audit-2026-04-24-ai-resources.md read in full (~200 lines) for carry-forward findings; a targeted grep or short summary would have served the same purpose.

**Recommendation:** Wire /collaboration-coach to write full analysis to a working-notes file on disk and return only a ≤20-line summary to the main session — matching the notes-to-disk contract already in place for token-audit-auditor-mechanical and permission-sweep-auditor. This eliminates ~300 lines of coaching content from main-session context per monthly/weekly run (higher multiplier during mixed-tier sessions with 3+ scopes).

**Estimated savings:** ~4k tokens per mixed-tier session with 3 /coach invocations (~1.3k per invocation × 3). At weekly cadence with 1-2 /coach calls, ~1.3k–2.6k per run. Derivation: 100-line return → ~1.3k tokens × 3 scopes = ~4k avoided in main context; disk write is ~200 tokens, net save ~3.8k per full monthly run.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
1. **token-audit-protocol.md caching (~8k tokens/run):** If the protocol is unchanged since last audit, allow the auditor to load a compact "no-change confirmation" instead of full re-read. Potentially larger than the primary recommendation on single-scope audit sessions, but requires a change-detection mechanism (hash or git log check) so implementation cost is higher.
2. **Carry-forward findings via grep (~2.5k tokens/run):** Prior audit read in full for ~3 carry-forward findings. A targeted grep for flagged patterns or a 10-line summary-only prior-audit read would avoid ~2.5k tokens. Lower ROI than /coach fix across mixed-tier runs, but near-zero implementation cost.
3. **session-notes.md tail re-read (~200 tokens/run):** Two tail reads (pre-append check + coaching-data tail) could collapse into one batched read. Minimal absolute saving but a clean batching habit that compounds across high-frequency appends.

### 2026-04-25 | Acceptable

**Task:** Designed and landed five preventative fixes (F1-F5) for working-tree drift and concurrent-session damage, including plan-mode design with 2 parallel Explore agents and 2 /risk-check gates that redirected F2 design and dropped G5.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | ~16 |
| Files read | 13 (re-reads: 2) |
| Files written/edited | 10 |
| Tool calls | ~57 |
| Subagents | 5 |
| Rework cycles | 1 (F2 design pivot, pre-implementation) |

**Findings:**
- permission-template.md read in 3 partial passes (offsets 1, 100, 183) covering full 285-line file — single full read would have saved 2 round-trips (Re-reads / context handling, Moderate)
- permission-sweep-auditor.md edited 3 separate times for "13"→"14" substitutions — could have collapsed to 1-2 edits using replace_all or unique substring matching (Tool overhead, Minor)
- coaching-data.md tail re-read once at near-identical offsets (Re-reads, Minor — immaterial)
- F2 design pivot via /risk-check RECONSIDER reflects the gate working as intended, not artifact rework — no implementation tokens lost
- Stable vs. last 3 entries (all Acceptable): same rating, similar moderate-finding profile around partial-read patterns and small Edit-batching inefficiencies.

**Recommendation:** When a reference file is <300 lines and the task requires scanning most of it, default to one full Read rather than chained partial offsets — partial-read pattern only pays off above ~400 lines or when a single section is clearly load-bearing.

**Estimated savings:** Per-session ~1.5-2k tokens (2 redundant partial-read round-trips on permission-template.md ≈ ~1.2k tokens of duplicated structural overhead + 1 collapsible Edit cycle ≈ ~300-500 tokens). 10-20 session projection: ~15-40k tokens, assuming the partial-read pattern recurs in ~half of multi-file plan-mode sessions.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
- Batch consecutive same-file Edits when the substitution is a simple find/replace — replace_all=true on the unique pattern saves ~600-1000 tokens per occurrence vs. 3 sequential Edits; bigger than primary on edit-heavy sessions.
- Cap risk-check + qc-reviewer reports at summary-only re-reads in main session — already doing this for F3+G5; codify as default. ~400-800 tokens per subagent report avoided; smaller than primary because the discipline is already mostly observed.
- Skip TodoWrite reminders mid-execution on linear 5-step plans where progression is self-evident — ~200-400 tokens per session in tool overhead and re-narration; smaller than primary, mostly orchestration noise.
- Consolidate workspace + ai-resources commit narration into single chat summary when both repos take coordinated commits in same flow — ~200-300 tokens per multi-repo session; smallest lever.

### 2026-04-24 | Acceptable

**Task:** Executed Batch 1 of Commission v4 — built `/risk-check` command + `risk-check-reviewer` Opus subagent as a pre-execution gate, added class list + pause-trigger #9 across `docs/audit-discipline.md` and workspace CLAUDE.md. One QC → triage → fix → post-edit QC cycle; committed to two repos.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | ~20 |
| Files read | ~18 (re-reads: 4 on session-notes.md, 3 on innovation-registry.md, 2 on decisions.md/coaching-data.md/improvement-log.md + settings.json across locations) |
| Files written/edited | 9 (2 new commands/agents, 1 subagent-authored audit, 6 edits) |
| Tool calls | ~50 |
| Subagents | 4 |
| Rework cycles | 1 (risk-check.md structural rewrite post-QC) |

**Findings:**
- risk-check.md rewritten via full Write (~122 lines) after QC REVISE when the 3 Do items were structural (path ordering, new subsections, item renumbering) — justified choice but pays full payload twice (initial + rewrite). (Rework, Moderate)
- risk-check-reviewer.md agent body (~215 lines / ~5k tokens) inlined into a `general-purpose` subagent prompt because new agents don't hot-register mid-session — significant one-off prompt duplication unique to creation-session dogfooding. (Tool overhead, Moderate)
- session-notes.md read 4x due to concurrent-session edits invalidating the file between Edit attempts — externally caused, but the re-reads still consume budget. (Re-reads, Moderate)
- innovation-registry.md touched 3x via separate bash grep + head + grep calls when a single Read would have sufficed for an ~80-line ledger — same tail-before-read anti-pattern noted in the prior entry. (Tool overhead, Minor)
- Stable relative to last 3 entries (Acceptable / Acceptable / Acceptable) — no regression, and the rework-via-full-Write pattern persists for the third session running, indicating a durable sub-pattern worth addressing structurally.

**Recommendation:** For creation-session dogfooding of new agents, skip the mid-session inline-body workaround — either run the new agent at the top of the next session (free registration, zero inlined-prompt tokens) or invoke it via a minimal stub brief that references the agent file path rather than pasting its full body. The ~5k-token prompt-duplication cost is the largest single avoidable item in this session.

**Estimated savings:** ~5k tokens per creation-session-with-dogfood by deferring the first real invocation to the next session (one ~215-line agent body × ~23 tokens/line ≈ 5k tokens saved). Over 10–20 agent-creation sessions: ~50–100k tokens, assuming half of new agents get dogfooded same-session today.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
- Avoid the double-Write-on-QC-rework pattern by writing risk-check.md initial draft to ~90% completeness with QC-anticipated structure already in place, then using targeted Edits for Do items — saves ~122 lines × ~20 tokens/line ≈ 2.5k tokens per rework cycle. Smaller than primary because rework is conditional on QC REVISE; primary is deterministic per creation session.
- Collapse innovation-registry / decisions / coaching-data / improvement-log wrap-step reads into a single orchestrated read pass rather than 4 separate tail/grep/read sequences — ~1–2k tokens per wrap across those ledger files. Smaller than primary because each individual file is small, but recurs every session.
- When concurrent-session activity is disclosed at session start, write session-notes.md entries as append-only EOF edits from the outset rather than attempting chronological insertion — avoids the 2–3 extra Reads caused by concurrent-edit races. ~1k tokens per affected session; smaller than primary because it only applies when a concurrent session is active.

### 2026-04-24 | Acceptable

**Task:** Planning-only session — iterated a 5-batch implementation plan for weekly Friday repo maintenance cadence through /clarify → /recommend → /qc-pass → /triage → post-edit /qc-pass. Plan file lives outside the repo; no code changes committed.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | ~15 |
| Files read | 8 (re-reads: 1) |
| Files written/edited | 5 |
| Tool calls | ~44 |
| Subagents | 5 |
| Rework cycles | 2 |

**Findings:**
- Plan file rewritten via full Write twice (~300 lines each) when the second rewrite could have been done via surgical Edits — batch renumbering from merging Batches 2+3 drove the choice, but a full rewrite re-pays the entire file payload on the second write. (Rework, Moderate)
- innovation-registry.md read twice (Bash tail ~15 lines, then full Read of all 78 lines) after an Edit attempt required fresh content — classic tail-before-read anti-pattern where the tail output was discarded. (Re-reads, Minor)
- Five subagents spawned for a single planning artifact (2 Explore + 3 QC/triage) — protocol-compliant under the QC → Triage Auto-Loop, but the two Explore passes could arguably have been merged into one brief covering both Friday cadence and audit-command substrate. (Tool overhead, Moderate)
- ExitPlanMode rejected once because handoff notes were missing — one wasted plan-mode cycle that a self-check against the /recommend checklist would have caught before the first submission. (Rework, Minor)
- Stable relative to last 3 entries (Acceptable / Acceptable / Efficient) — same moderate-rework pattern as 2026-04-22, no regression.

**Recommendation:** When a plan file needs >2 non-adjacent changes including renumbering, prefer a single full rewrite via Write over mixing Write+Edit; when changes are <5 and localized, stay on Edit. The middle ground — first full rewrite then another batch of Edits on the same artifact — is the waste shape to avoid.

**Estimated savings:** ~2–3k tokens per planning session by avoiding the second full-rewrite Write (the v2→v3 inline edits could have stayed pure Edit). ~20–60k tokens over 10–20 plan-heavy sessions.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
- Merge the two Explore subagents into one combined brief covering cadence + audit-substrate discovery — subagent briefs and returned findings (~1300 words combined) would drop to a single ~800-word synthesis. ~3–5k tokens per multi-domain planning session; bigger than primary because subagent invocation overhead dominates full-rewrite cost.
- Read innovation-registry.md (and similarly sized ledger files ≤100 lines) once in full rather than tail-then-Read — Bash tail for files under ~200 lines is almost never worth it. ~500–1k tokens per affected session; smaller than primary because ledger files are small.
- Add a self-check gate before ExitPlanMode that verifies handoff notes, concurrent-session disclosure, and approval-readiness — prevents one-turn rejection cycles. ~300–800 tokens per avoided rejection; smaller than primary but reduces interactional friction.

### 2026-04-24 | Acceptable

**Task:** Ran /friday-checkup monthly-tier audit scoped to ai-resources (narrowed from 4 scopes). Executed /audit-repo, /improve, /coach, /token-audit in sequence; produced consolidated checkup report plus 11-section token-audit report.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | ~15 |
| Files read | 16 (re-reads: 0) |
| Files written/edited | 8 |
| Tool calls | ~60 |
| Subagents | 6 |
| Rework cycles | 0 |

**Findings:**
- /coach subagent returned ~100 lines of full analysis to main session while a compact ~15-line entry was also written to `logs/coaching-log.md` — the full return adds ~4–8k tokens to main-session context for the remainder of the session, duplicating content already archived to disk. (Context bloat, Moderate)
- /token-audit report built via 1 Write + ~9 sequential Edit calls; protocol-driven design (incremental appends for interruption safety), but each Edit re-pays the file-write tool overhead. (Tool overhead, Minor)
- `audits/token-audit-protocol.md` read in full at 633 lines (~8.2k tokens) — single read, protocol-mandated as session-resident, so not avoidable under current design but dominates read-side cost. (Context bloat, Minor)
- Sections 2 and 6 of /token-audit correctly launched in parallel; Section 4 ran sequentially after. No dependency was documented between Section 4 and the others. (Missed parallelization, Minor)
- Stable relative to last 3 entries (Acceptable / Efficient / Wasteful / Acceptable) — no regression; same moderate-bloat pattern as 2026-04-22.

**Recommendation:** Update /coach skill so the coaching subagent writes its full analysis to disk (e.g., `logs/coaching-analysis-{date}.md`) and returns only the ~15-line compact entry to the main session, mirroring the token-audit subagent output-to-disk contract.

**Estimated savings:** ~4–8k tokens per /coach invocation (the ~100-line full return no longer lands in main context). Derivation: ~100 lines × ~60 tokens/line ≈ 6k tokens eliminated from downstream turns in the same session. Over a 10–20 session horizon with /coach running in each Friday checkup plus ad-hoc use (~8–15 invocations), projected savings ~50–120k tokens.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
- Launch /token-audit Section 4 in parallel with Sections 2 and 6 (all three are independent mechanical/research audits) — saves one sequential subagent round-trip, ~2–5k tokens of orchestration overhead per /token-audit run.
- Batch the /token-audit report construction: reduce the 1 Write + ~9 Edit pattern to 1 Write + 2–3 Edits by grouping sections written together (e.g., Sections 1–3 as one Edit, 4–7 as another). Saves ~6–9 tool-call round-trips per audit; minor per-session but compounds monthly.
- Consider whether `audits/token-audit-protocol.md` (633 lines) can be split into a short "session-resident" core (~150 lines of rules actually needed in-context) plus a reference appendix loaded only when a specific section needs it. Largest single read of the session; ~5–6k tokens recoverable per /token-audit run if split.

### 2026-04-22 | Acceptable

**Task:** Implemented 6 of 7 P0+P1 improvements from the 2026-04-21 setup-improvement-scan across three nested git repos, with one deferral (SC-02, unverifiable baseline) and one mid-execution adaptation (1→3 commits after nested-repo discovery).

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | 13 |
| Files read | ~21 (re-reads: 0) |
| Files written/edited | 15 |
| Tool calls | ~60 total |
| Subagents | 4 |
| Rework cycles | 1 (partial — caught pre-commit) |

**Findings:**
- Context bloat (Moderate): ~1,660 lines of working-notes + report files read upfront before plan-mode exploration — `setup-scan-bssp-archives-b-2026-04-21.md` (602 lines), plus four other scan/report files (248–280 lines each) all loaded in full. Validate whether full reads were needed or section-targeted reads would have sufficed.
- Rework (Minor, sub-moderate): 1 partial correction to produce-formatting.md Phase 3 subagent brief caught at verification before commit — not a completed-output rework cycle, but the plan's exploration missed the Phase 3 pass-list gap.
- Planning gap (Moderate, classified as Context bloat): Plan assumed single-repo commit scope; nested-repo boundaries (workspace / ai-resources / bssp) not verified during exploration, forcing mid-execution restructure from 1 to 3 commits.
- Trend vs. last 3 entries (Efficient / Acceptable / Wasteful): stable — matches the prior Acceptable entry (multi-phase edit with a structural gap), not a regression toward the Wasteful rework-heavy session.

**Recommendation:** When the task input is a scan/audit report, read the executive summary + prioritized-items section first, then selectively load working-notes only for items the executor will act on — avoid full-read of all working-notes files upfront.

**Estimated savings:** ~1,100 lines × ~12 tokens/line = ~13k tokens avoidable per scan-driven session (assuming ~33% of the 1,660 lines read were genuinely load-bearing for the 7 items acted on). Over a 10–20 session horizon of similar scan-driven implementation work: ~130k–260k tokens.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
- Verify repo boundaries during Phase 1 exploration (cheap `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` per target directory, ~200 tokens) to prevent commit-phase restructuring. Smaller than primary (single-digit k tokens saved per occurrence) but cheaper to implement — pure process addition.
- Single-Explore-agent consolidation where SC-items share file scope: the 3 parallel Explore agents returned 300–500 lines each (~1.2k–1.5k lines total); if two of the three could have been merged by scope (e.g., commands + CLAUDE.md share the workspace dir), estimated ~4–6k tokens saved. Smaller than primary because parallel Explore is a deliberate speed/coverage tradeoff, not waste.
- Defer SC-02-style items at scan-triage time, not implementation time: the git-history search for the 2026-03-28 baseline was sunk cost by the time deferral was decided. Adding a "verify baseline exists" gate to scan output would prevent ~1–2k tokens of dead-end verification per unverifiable item. Smaller than primary because the scan itself would need the gate logic added.
- No fourth lever — remaining inefficiencies are below the material-waste threshold.

### 2026-04-21 | Efficient

**Task:** Created `/recommend` slash command as operator-facing counterpart to `/clarify`. Single 15-line prompt-only command file, plan-mode-gated with qc-reviewer validation.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | 14 |
| Files read | 8 (re-reads: 2) |
| Files written/edited | 4 |
| Tool calls | ~28 |
| Subagents | 1 |
| Rework cycles | 1 |

**Findings:**
- Plan file took 1 QC cycle (PARTIAL verdict → 2 substantive fixes → operator approval without second QC) — within the normal QC→Triage auto-loop envelope, not waste (Rework, Minor/expected).
- Two small-file tail re-reads (session-notes.md ~10 lines 2x, coaching-data.md partial 2x) for append-point verification before Edit — cheap and functional, not material (Re-reads, Minor).
- One failed git commit from workspace root (nested-repo confusion) retried from inside ai-resources — single cheap retry (Tool overhead, Minor).
- Mid-session scope expansion ("hint for when to use /recommend") retracted by operator before execution — zero artifact cost, clean retraction (no category).
- STOP interrupt mid-AskUserQuestion preparation prevented an unneeded 3-option prompt — avoided waste rather than caused it.
- Significant improvement vs. prior two entries (Wasteful 6 cycles / 7 subagents, then Acceptable 2 cycles / 5 subagents) — this session: 1 cycle / 1 subagent, tight scope throughout.

**Recommendation:** No action needed.

**Estimated savings:** N/A

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
- Session shape is the target profile for single-file prompt-only command creation — one qc-reviewer pass on plan, no subagent output duplication to disk, targeted Edits rather than wholesale rewrites. Worth codifying as the reference envelope for `/create-skill`-adjacent command authoring.
- Marginal: the two small-file tail re-reads (~20 lines total) could be collapsed by reading once and pinning the append-point offset, but savings are <500 tokens/session — not worth the discipline overhead.
- Marginal: the failed-commit retry could be avoided by checking `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` before staging when working near nested-repo boundaries — ~300–500 tokens/session on affected sessions only, low frequency.

### 2026-04-21 | Wasteful

**Task:** Created new shared skill `prose-refinement-writer` via /create-skill to address unclear sentence-to-sentence logical shifts and underdeveloped hardest claims in produce-prose-draft output.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | 15 |
| Files read | 10 (re-reads: 3) |
| Files written/edited | 7 |
| Tool calls | ~49 |
| Subagents | 7 |
| Rework cycles | 6 |

**Findings:**
- Artifact `prose-refinement-writer/SKILL.md` required 2 rework cycles (cold-evaluator fixes + workspace-QC-auto-loop recovery with regression fix) and plan file required 2 rework cycles (post-QC rewrite + Document-1 fold-in before ExitPlanMode) — 4 cycles across two artifacts (Rework, Major).
- Process compliance slip: skipped the workspace CLAUDE.md QC→Triage auto-loop after cold-evaluator findings, triggering operator challenge and 3 extra subagent spawns (triage + post-edit QC + regression Edit) to recover (Rework, Major).
- Plan file `fix-produse-prose-with-luminous-rain.md` (~85 lines) read 3x; `prose-refinement-writer/SKILL.md` (~267 lines) read 2x; `coaching-data.md` tail read 2x — re-reads on artifacts being actively edited (Re-reads, Moderate).
- Plan file edited multiple times via small Edits, then rewritten wholesale — several pre-rewrite edits were superseded (Tool overhead, Moderate).
- One Bash `find` used where Glob would have been cleaner tool choice (Tool overhead, Minor).
- No prior entries for comparison.

**Recommendation:** Before invoking /create-skill, confirm which QC loop governs the pipeline (workspace CLAUDE.md auto-loop vs. local Step 4a triage) so the correct flow runs the first time — prevents the recovery cascade that added 3 subagent spawns and a regression Edit this session.

**Estimated savings:** ~8–12k tokens per skill-creation session when the workspace QC auto-loop is followed the first time. Derivation: 3 avoided subagent spawns (triage + post-edit qc-reviewer + regression Edit cycle) at ~3–4k tokens each including brief + output = ~9–12k. Over 10–20 skill-creation sessions: ~80–240k tokens avoided, plus the corresponding rework turns.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
- Outline-first plan drafting before first QC: the plan needed a full rewrite after initial qc-reviewer (REVISE, 1 HIGH + 5 MEDIUM) — ~5–8k tokens saved per session by running a quick self-check against the QC rubric before spawning the external reviewer. Smaller than the primary because it only affects the plan artifact, not the skill artifact.
- Pin the plan file content after first read instead of re-reading 3x (~85 lines × 2 redundant reads ≈ 1–2k tokens) and same for SKILL.md (~267 lines × 1 redundant read ≈ 2–3k tokens) — total ~3–5k/session. Smaller than the primary because re-reads are on small-to-mid files.
- Consolidate small plan-file Edits into one batch after QC rather than iterative single-line Edits that get superseded by the wholesale rewrite — ~1–2k tokens saved per QC cycle. Smallest lever because each wasted Edit is cheap individually.

### 2026-04-21 | Acceptable

**Task:** Refactored produce-prose-draft.md Phases 2–5 to pass absolute paths instead of inlining two reference docs into subagent briefs; updated four skill input contracts and added a Context Isolation Rules carve-out. Separately audited settings.json files and fixed a nested-`.claude/**` glob gap firing permission prompts.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | 15 |
| Files read | 17 (re-reads: 2) |
| Files written/edited | 12 |
| Tool calls | ~51 |
| Subagents | 5 |
| Rework cycles | 2 |

**Findings:**
- Plan artifact required 1 full rewrite + 2 minor post-edit fixes after REVISE verdict surfaced 1 HIGH governance + 1 HIGH commit-window + 4 MEDIUM issues — spec gaps at plan-authoring time (Rework, Moderate).
- Initial settings fix landed in workspace repo only; operator challenge ("fixed in EVERY project?") forced a second audit pass across all 10 settings.json files and a second commit to ai-resources — scope framed too narrowly on first pass (Rework, Moderate).
- produce-prose-draft.md (208 lines) read 2–3x across Phase 2/3/4/5 checks via partial reads — acceptable for a multi-phase edit but near the threshold (Re-reads, Minor).
- 7 project settings.json files read via batched Bash cat (~400 lines) during audit — broad context load, only 2 files ultimately edited (Context bloat, Minor).
- Permission prompt fired on `.claude/commands/produce-prose-draft.md` edit despite autonomy grant; narrated as if Claude was asking — auto-memory note existed but did not change behavior (Tool overhead, Minor).
- Rating represents improvement vs prior entry (2026-04-21 Wasteful, 6 rework cycles, 7 subagents) — fewer subagents, fewer rework loops, tighter scope.

**Recommendation:** When authoring plans that span multiple artifacts + harness config, run the `qc-reviewer` subagent on the plan draft BEFORE ExitPlanMode — not after operator challenge. Would have caught both the governance/commit-window gaps and the narrow-scope settings framing before any execution cost.

**Estimated savings:** Plan rework cycle (rewrite + 2 post-edit fixes + second QC subagent pass) ≈ 6–8k tokens per avoided rework. At ~1 planning session per working block, projects to ~60–150k tokens over 10–20 sessions.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
- Pin produce-prose-draft.md once at session start (208 lines × 2–3 reads = ~4–6k redundant tokens). Bigger than the typical re-read lever because this is a central command file touched across 4 phases — any multi-phase edit session will re-encounter it. Projects to ~40–80k over 10–20 sessions.
- Scope harness-config audits to a single subagent brief that enumerates ALL candidate files upfront rather than iterating after operator challenge (~3–5k tokens per audit by avoiding the second round). Smaller than the primary because harness-config audits are less frequent than planning sessions.
- Batch the four skill-contract edits into one Read + one Edit per file pattern (already mostly done this session, but one-file-at-a-time drift cost ~1–2k) — smallest lever, included for completeness since the pattern is reusable across future multi-skill contract updates.

### 2026-04-25 | Acceptable

**Task:** Adopted two-gate trigger model for `/risk-check` (plan-time + end-time) replacing per-change firing — edited workspace `CLAUDE.md` pause-trigger #9 (×2, expand then trim), `audits/audit-discipline.md`, `risk-check.md`, `wrap-session.md`; ran self-applied `/risk-check` returning PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION with two paired mitigations applied.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | 11 |
| Files read | 13 (re-reads: 0 for same content; 4 ledger files touched via head + tail-via-bash dual-call pattern) |
| Files written/edited | 9 |
| Tool calls | ~32 |
| Subagents | 1 |
| Rework cycles | 1 |

**Findings:**
- Workspace `CLAUDE.md` pause-trigger #9 written first as a ~10-line expansion, then trimmed to ~95 words after end-time `/risk-check` flagged the always-loaded surcharge — full payload paid twice on the same load-bearing section. (Rework, Moderate)
- Four ledger files (`session-notes.md`, `decisions.md`, `coaching-data.md`, `innovation-registry.md`) each touched via separate `Read` head + `Bash` tail sequences when a single full Read of files ≤100 lines would have sufficed — same tail-before-read anti-pattern flagged in 2026-04-24 entry, third session running. (Tool overhead, Moderate)
- Concurrent-session collision swept the `wrap-session.md` Step 13b edit into the other session's commit — externally caused, no extra reads triggered this session, but the staging-discipline check before the edit could have detected the active concurrent context earlier. (Tool overhead, Minor)
- Stable relative to last 3 entries (Acceptable / Acceptable / Acceptable) — no regression; the ledger-file tail-before-read pattern persists for the third session, reinforcing it as a structural sub-pattern.

**Recommendation:** When wrap-step touches the standard ledger set (session-notes, decisions, coaching-data, innovation-registry, improvement-log), do a single Read pass per file at append-point — no Bash tail precursor — for any ledger ≤200 lines. The tail call is almost never load-bearing for files this size and doubles the per-ledger tool overhead.

**Estimated savings:** ~1–2k tokens per wrap session (4 ledger files × ~300–500 tokens of avoided tail+head dual reads each). Over 10–20 wrap sessions: ~10–40k tokens. Smaller than typical creation-session levers but recurs every session that runs `/wrap-session`.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
- Anticipate the always-loaded surcharge before drafting `CLAUDE.md` pause-trigger or rule edits — set a target word budget (e.g., ≤100 words for a single pause-trigger entry) at the start, draft to fit, then run `/risk-check`. Saves ~2–3k tokens per always-loaded edit by avoiding the expand-then-trim cycle and the second `Edit` payload. Bigger than primary on policy-edit sessions; smaller frequency than the wrap-ledger pattern.
- When concurrent-session disclosure is known at session start, scope `wrap-session.md` and other shared infra edits earlier in the session so commit-boundary collisions are visible before the other session wraps — saves 1 lost edit + 1 lost commit-boundary attribution per affected session, ~1–2k tokens of recovery overhead. Smaller than primary because concurrent-session collisions are infrequent.
- Self-applied `/risk-check` worked — the gate caught the always-loaded surcharge that the main agent's draft missed. Worth codifying as a lever: for any always-loaded-content edit, make plan-time `/risk-check` mandatory rather than discretionary. Zero token savings (it's a quality lever, not a cost lever) but prevents the rework-cycle cost above.

### 2026-04-27 | Acceptable

**Task:** Ran `/innovation-sweep` against `projects/buy-side-service-plan` (76-item triage), used `/recommend` to autonomously graduate 5 candidates (4 hooks + 1 command), applied `/risk-check` PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION mitigations mid-flight, closed with `/qc-pass` REVISE on settings.json registration patch and committed.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | ~18 |
| Files read | ~30 (re-reads: 4 on settings.json) |
| Files written/edited | 9 |
| Tool calls | ~56 |
| Subagents | 4 |
| Rework cycles | 2 (minor — save-session.md path fix; hook fallback path generalization) |

**Findings:**
- `ai-resources/.claude/settings.json` read ~4 times across the session (~100 lines each pass) — verification cycles after each Edit (jq parse + jq structure check + post-QC re-read) where pinning content after the first full read and trusting Edit's exact-match guarantee would have collapsed the duplicate reads. (Re-reads, Moderate)
- `Read(audits/working/**)` deny rule blocked main-session reads of the 200+ line `innovation-notes-snapshot.md`, forcing a `cp` to /tmp workaround — pure overhead with no analytical value, and `/innovation-sweep` design gap surfaced. (Tool overhead, Moderate)
- Multiple jq verification calls on settings.json after each Edit pass (~3-4 separate jq invocations across the session) where a single combined jq query (parse + structure + matcher check) would have sufficed per Edit. (Tool overhead, Minor)
- 5 graduation candidates handled via `/recommend` batch rather than 5 separate `/graduate-resource` flows — saved ~5 command-flow round-trips, correct call. (No category — efficiency win)
- `/risk-check` operator-invoked mid-flight; end-time `/risk-check` correctly skipped to avoid duplicate scope coverage — correct deduplication. (No category)
- Stable relative to last 3 entries (Acceptable / Acceptable / Acceptable) — same moderate settings-file re-read pattern as 2026-04-25's ledger-tail anti-pattern, fourth session running with file-touch-then-verify cycles dominating per-session waste.

**Recommendation:** When editing harness-config files (settings.json, hook scripts) and verifying with jq or structural checks, pin the file content in context after the first full Read and rely on Edit's exact-match guarantee for subsequent passes — verification re-reads should target only the 5–10 lines around the edit point, not full re-reads of the file.

**Estimated savings:** ~3–4k tokens per harness-config-edit session. Derivation: 3 redundant full reads of settings.json × ~100 lines × ~12 tokens/line ≈ 3.6k tokens of duplicated structural overhead. Over 10–20 sessions touching `.claude/settings.json` (graduation, permission-sweep, and friday-checkup runs are all candidates): ~30–80k tokens.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
- Fix the `/innovation-sweep` design gap that requires a `cp audits/working/... /tmp/...` workaround — the deny rule on `audits/working/**` blocks main-session reads of the snapshot the command itself produced. Either narrow the deny rule or have `/innovation-sweep` write the operator-facing snapshot to a non-denied path. ~1–2k tokens per run avoided (the `cp` Bash + retry overhead) plus removes a recurring friction surface. Bigger than primary on every `/innovation-sweep` run; smaller in frequency since `/innovation-sweep` is project-end.
- Batch the jq verifications into a single combined query (`jq '.hooks.PostToolUse | length, .permissions.allow | length, type'`) rather than 3–4 separate parse/structure checks per Edit. ~500–1k tokens per harness-config-edit session in tool-call overhead and re-narration. Smaller than primary because jq calls are cheap individually.
- When a graduation involves cross-project event-matcher mismatch (here: source project registered hooks under `Stop`, graduated copies registered under `PostToolUse[Write|Edit]`), surface the latent source-project bug as a separate housekeeping note at graduation time rather than discovering it during `/risk-check` mitigation — saves ~500–800 tokens of mid-flight context-switching per affected graduation. Smaller than primary because graduation events are infrequent.

### 2026-04-28 | Efficient

**Task:** Added Step 1 precondition trigger-check guardrails to `/triage` and `/recommend` commands so both refuse to run when their preconditions aren't met; one mechanical-mode QC pass returned GO with zero findings.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | ~10 |
| Files read | not reported |
| Files written/edited | 2 |
| Tool calls | not reported |
| Subagents | 1 |
| Rework cycles | 0 |

**Findings:**
- Mechanical-mode QC pass returned GO with all M-checks Clear and zero findings — correct rubric selection and tight scope kept the QC → Triage Auto-Loop short-circuited (skipped per workspace rule when QC GO + mechanical-mode + Clear). (No category — efficiency win)
- One isolated permission prompt fired on the second Edit (recommend.md) under bypassPermissions mode — diagnosed as harness-side transient, not a settings gap; no structural rework triggered. (Tool overhead, Minor — not actionable)
- Improvement vs. last 3 entries (Acceptable / Acceptable / Acceptable) — first Efficient rating in the recent window; small infra-edit with disciplined scope, no drafting, no QC re-runs.

**Recommendation:** No action needed.

**Estimated savings:** N/A — no recommendation.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
- Session shape is the target profile for symmetric guardrail edits across paired infra commands — single decision (precondition-gate over rename), two parallel surgical Edits, single mechanical-mode QC, commit. Worth codifying as the reference envelope for Step-1-precondition-style edits to small command pairs.
- Marginal: the bypassPermissions transient on Edit #2 is environmental noise — not worth a discipline change unless it recurs across multiple sessions on the same edit shape.

### 2026-05-01 | Acceptable

**Task:** /friday-act (monthly tier) against 2026-05-01 checkup — resolved 3 of 14 tactical items, investigated 4 auditor false positives, deleted pre-migration usage/usage-log.md, captured 2 policy proposals.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | ~18 |
| Files read | ~19 (re-reads: 0) |
| Files written/edited | 5 |
| Tool calls | ~52 |
| Subagents | 2 |
| Rework cycles | 0 |

**Findings:**
- **Tool overhead — Minor:** /resolve aborted after 1 scan (no QC context) — ~3 tool calls wasted. Expected given session shape; no action needed.
- **False-positive overhead — Moderate:** 4 of 14 tactical items were auditor false positives ({{WORKSPACE_ROOT}} template, permission-sweep CRITICAL, Read(audits/**) recommendation, research-extract-verifier frontmatter). Each required reads + bash calls with no file changes produced. Pattern is the same root cause: auditors don't model bypass-mode posture, template-class files, or multi-line frontmatter.
- **Context bloat — Minor:** session-usage-analyzer SKILL.md read in full (149 lines) — protocol-mandated per wrap-session flow.

**Recommendation:** Add a triage pre-filter in the /friday-act checklist or auditor rules to suppress false-positive classes before the operator sees them. If the false-positive rate across 2 more Friday cycles stays above 25% of tactical items, treat it as a systemic signal to fix the auditors (policy proposals already captured in maintenance-observations.md).

**Estimated savings:** ~16k tokens/Friday-act cycle (4 false-positive items × ~4k investigation cost each). Over 12 cycles/year ≈ ~192k tokens/year if root-cause auditor fixes land.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
- Root-cause auditor fix (policy proposals A and A2 in maintenance-observations.md) — eliminates the false-positive overhead at the source; higher ROI than any per-session triage filter.
- /resolve early-abort cost (3 tool calls) — negligible; not worth a dedicated fix.

### 2026-05-08 | Acceptable

**Task:** Built new `/friday-journal` command (~200 lines, model: opus, 7 steps) plus `logs/ai-journal.md` template, integrated into `/friday-act` via four edits (Steps 1.5/3/3.5/5 + Notes), and updated `weekly-cadence.md` and `operator-maintenance-cadence.md` (F3.5 rows). Plan-time and end-time `/risk-check` gates passed; committed as c3b1c15.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | ~25 |
| Files read | ~12 (re-reads: 2 — friday-act.md ×2 across step edits, weekly-cadence.md ×2 plan→edit) |
| Files written/edited | 8 (4 created, 4 modified) |
| Tool calls | ~60 |
| Subagents | 5 (qc-reviewer ×3, risk-check-reviewer ×2) |
| Rework cycles | 3 (plan v1→v2 post-QC, plan v2→v3 post-QC, friday-journal.md v1→v2 post-QC) |

**Findings:**
- **Rework — Major:** Plan artifact required 2 QC REVISE cycles (v1→v2→v3) before ExitPlanMode approval; friday-journal.md required 1 QC REVISE cycle (variable rename JOURNAL_PATH→JOURNAL_SOURCE, entry-splitting clarification, same-day collision handling). 3 rework cycles total across 2 artifacts. Each REVISE surfaced real fixes, not arbitrary rejections, but the plan needing two passes suggests the v1 spec missed structural issues a tighter outline-first pass would have caught.
- **Tool overhead — Moderate:** Mid-session /fewer-permission-prompts diagnosis fired on unrelated permission-prompt friction — root-caused to deny-list in `ai-resources/.claude/settings.json`, logged to ai-journal.md, but did not fix this session. Pure context drift from main task; ~2–3k tokens spent on a tangential diagnosis logged for later /risk-check + remediation rather than executed in-flight or deferred entirely.
- **Re-reads — Minor:** friday-act.md read across 4 separate step-edit cycles (Steps 1.5/3/3.5/5 + Notes); weekly-cadence.md read at plan-time then again at edit-time. Tail-then-section pattern recurring.
- **Subagent volume — Acceptable:** 5 subagents (3 QC + 2 risk-check) is on-protocol — QC→Triage Auto-Loop convergence behavior, not waste. Both /risk-check gates fired correctly (plan-time PROCEED-WITH-CAUTION with 4 mitigations, end-time GO confirming mitigations applied).

Stable relative to last 3 entries (Wasteful 2026-05-08 / Acceptable 2026-05-05 / Acceptable 2026-05-01) — same Acceptable rating as the two pre-checkup sessions; the multi-cycle plan QC matches the rework pattern in 2026-05-05 (3 in-context plan revisions before disk write).

**Recommendation:** Before invoking the first /qc-pass on a plan artifact, run a self-check against the QC rubric (governance, commit-window, scope, structural completeness) — same lever flagged in 2026-04-21 and 2026-05-05 entries. Two plan REVISE cycles in this session each surfaced single-class structural issues a self-check would have caught upstream, converting two external QC subagent rounds into one.

**Estimated savings:** ~6–8k tokens per plan-heavy session by collapsing two QC REVISE cycles into one. Derivation: 1 avoided qc-reviewer subagent invocation (~3k brief + ~3–4k return) plus 1 avoided plan rewrite cycle (~150 lines × ~13 tokens/line ≈ 2k). Over 10–20 plan-heavy sessions: ~60–160k tokens. Recurring pattern flagged third session running.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
1. **Defer mid-session tangential diagnoses (~2–3k/session):** When an unrelated friction surface (here: permission prompts) fires during a substantive build, log it to a friction or journal file and resume — do not spawn a diagnostic command (/fewer-permission-prompts) inline. Saves the full diagnostic round-trip cost; smaller than primary because tangential firings are sporadic, not deterministic.
2. **Pin friday-act.md once before multi-step edits (~1.5–2k/session):** ~70-line command file read across 4 step-edit cycles instead of pinned after first full Read. Smaller than primary because individual Reads are cheap but the pattern recurs on every multi-step infra-command edit session.
3. **Outline-first plan drafting (~3–5k/session):** Same lever flagged in 2026-04-21 — write plan v1 to ~90% completeness with QC-anticipated structure (governance, commit-window, scope, mitigations) before first QC. Eliminates one full plan rewrite per QC REVISE; bigger than the per-file pin lever, smaller than the primary because primary captures both QC cycles' worth of avoidable cost.

### 2026-05-08b | Acceptable

**Task:** Implemented /friday-journal output-validation gate (Steps 5.4 + 5.5 in friday-journal.md) from an approved plan; updated qc-reviewer.md description; archived 32 ai-journal entries; ran gate as a catch-up on today's existing report (7 findings applied, 12 risk-check flags added); drafted 8-suggestion improvement spec for /friday-journal.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | ~30 |
| Files read | ~10 (friday-journal.md ×2, qc-reviewer.md, ai-journal.md, friday-journal-2026-05-08.md, spec file, wrap logs) |
| Files written/edited | 7 (friday-journal.md, qc-reviewer.md, ai-journal.md, friday-journal-2026-05-08.md, improvement-spec, session-notes.md, decisions.md) |
| Tool calls | ~50 |
| Subagents | 2 (qc-reviewer: plan REVISE ×1, catch-up gate ×1) |
| Rework cycles | 1 (plan QC: REVISE → 6 fixes → operator approved) |

**Findings:**
- **Rework — Minor:** Plan received 1 QC REVISE with 6 items (rubric-override clarification, qc-reviewer contract, items_generated frontmatter field, r-disposition regex constraint, ls→Glob fix, heading-match set-equality). All were legitimate corrections; single-cycle convergence. Lower rework cost than the prior 2026-05-08 session (3 cycles across 2 artifacts).
- **Deliberate cost — Acceptable:** Catch-up gate run on already-generated report was operator-approved and proved value (12 risk-class flags caught that original generation missed). ~10 exchanges; expected for a non-routine catch-up.
- **Auto-compaction ×2:** Platform fired auto-compact twice during this session. Operator noted this in conversation. Not a session-efficiency issue — root cause is Claude Code's compaction threshold logic, not session design. Tracked as open question for investigation.
- **Improvement spec overhead — Minor:** 8-suggestion spec written at operator's explicit request. Per-suggestion analysis was thorough but produced a directly actionable artifact. Consistent with session scope.

**Recommendation:** No new pattern identified beyond those flagged in prior entries. The catch-up gate run was a one-time cost that surfaced real value; the auto-compaction issue warrants investigation as a platform-level concern.

**Estimated savings:** ~3–4k tokens/session by self-checking plans against QC rubric before first subagent QC invocation (recurring lever). No new session-specific lever identified.

### 2026-05-08c | Wasteful

**Task:** /friday-act Session 2 — dispositioned 43 items (12 checkup + 31 journal) from the 2026-05-08 friday-checkup and friday-journal reports into 15 fix-now / 35 defer / 1 skip. Produced 7 plan files under `audits/friday-plans/`.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | ~45 |
| Files read | ~20 (re-reads: 4 — SO advisory ×2 under-read→full; improvement-log.md ×3 across 3 projects) |
| Files written/edited | 15 |
| Tool calls | ~84 (Read ×30, Edit ×20, Bash ×20, Write ×8, Agent ×6) |
| Subagents | 6 (qc-reviewer ×2, triage-reviewer ×3, memory-write ×1) |
| Rework cycles | 4 (session plan QC REVISE ×1; prioritization QC REVISE ×1; SO advisory under-read correction ×1; improvement-log under-read correction ×1) |

**Findings:**
- **Rework — Major (recurring):** 3 revision passes required — initial disposition, SO advisory full-read correction, improvement-log correction — compounded scope beyond initial plan. Two passes were operator-caught under-reads, not QC-surfaced. Pattern: partial read treated as sufficient when file required full read for coverage. Third session in current window with multi-cycle rework driven by incomplete initial reads.
- **Re-reads — Major:** SO advisory read twice (30-line under-read then full read after operator challenge); improvement-log.md read across 3 separate project directories sequentially. Under-reads that required full re-reads on large files (SO advisory est. >200 lines) represent the most costly re-read pattern in recent log history.
- **Context bloat — Moderate:** 43-item disposition processed across ~45 exchanges — largest /friday-act execution yet; auto-compact fired mid-session, indicating context ceiling was reached. Scale-driven bloat, partially structural (large input scope), partially addressable by batching plan file writes earlier.
- **Tool overhead — Minor:** 6 subagents for a disposition + plan-file session within normal range for this scope; memory-write subagent adds minor overhead but appropriate for cross-session persistence.

Regression from prior 2026-05-08 entries (Acceptable / Acceptable) — first Wasteful rating in the current Friday cluster. Two MAJOR findings from operator-caught under-reads and multi-cycle rework distinguish this from the prior Acceptable sessions today.

**Recommendation:** When a file is referenced in the input scope (SO advisory, improvement-log entries) and the disposition task requires evaluating its content, default to a full read on first access — not a 30-line or section-scoped read. The cost of an under-read correction (re-read + rework + operator friction) exceeds the cost of the avoided full read in every case logged this session.

**Estimated savings:** ~8–12k tokens per /friday-act session. Derivation: 2 under-read corrections × (full re-read ~200 lines × ~13 tokens/line ≈ 2.6k) + rework cycle per correction (~2 exchanges × ~1.5k tokens/exchange) ≈ ~10k tokens of avoidable cost. Over 10–20 /friday-act sessions: ~80–200k tokens.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
1. **Write plan files to disk earlier in large-disposition sessions (~5–8k tokens/session):** With 43 items across 7 plan files, plan content accumulated in-context before first disk write, contributing to auto-compact trigger. Writing plan files incrementally as each thematic group is dispositioned reduces peak context load.
2. **Batch improvement-log reads into one pass per project at session start (~2–3k tokens/session):** improvement-log.md across 3 project directories read sequentially mid-session. A single orchestrated read pass at disposition start avoids mid-session context re-entry overhead.
3. **Scope gate on /friday-act input size (~15k tokens/large-session):** 43-item input triggered auto-compact; prior /friday-act sessions handled 14 items (Acceptable). A scope gate splitting sessions >25 items into two sub-sessions would prevent auto-compact context loss and reduce per-session rework risk.

### 2026-05-08d | Wasteful

**Task:** Ran /session-plan + QC pass on the plan + /systems-review (Function E) on full AI infrastructure. Produced a systems-thinking diagnosis with 5 leverage points and a W2.4 weekly implementation roadmap.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Exchanges | ~15 |
| Files read | 15 (re-reads: 7 on session-notes.md, 2 on decisions.md, 2 on session-plan.md, 2 on coaching-data.md, 2 on improvement-log.md) |
| Files written/edited | 6 |
| Tool calls | ~39 total |
| Subagents | 3 |
| Rework cycles | 1 |

**Findings:**
- logs/session-notes.md read 7 times across the session — 5 reads at progressively larger offsets during /prime to locate the most recent entry, then 2 more during /wrap-session. This is a Major re-reads finding (3x+ on a file with repeated offset scanning). Fix: on /prime, read from a large offset first (e.g., last 100 lines via Bash tail) rather than scanning forward from offset 0. (Re-reads — Major)
- logs/session-plan.md Write failed on first attempt because the file had not been read first; required an extra Read then retry Write round-trip. (Rework — Moderate)
- Trend: The prior three sessions rated Acceptable, Acceptable, Wasteful — this session is also Wasteful, indicating no improvement on the re-read pattern that triggered the previous Wasteful rating.

**Recommendation:** Replace the /prime session-notes.md forward-scan pattern with a single Bash tail call (e.g., `tail -n 100`) to locate the most recent entry in one call, eliminating the 5-read offset progression that dominates waste in lightweight sessions.

**Estimated savings:** ~6k tokens/session (4 surplus session-notes.md reads × ~1.5k tokens avg). Over 15 sessions: ~90k tokens.

**Additional levers (ROI-ranked):**
1. **Read-before-write discipline check at session start (~1–2k tokens/session):** Write failure on session-plan.md cost 1 extra Read + 1 failed Write call. At 15 sessions: ~15–30k tokens — smaller than primary but fully preventable.
2. **Batch /wrap-session reads into parallel Bash calls (~1–2k tokens/session):** decisions.md, coaching-data.md, improvement-log.md, session-notes.md tail currently run sequentially. Parallelizing saves marginal context overhead (~15–30k over 15 sessions).
3. No additional material levers — subagent volume (3) appropriate to session type; remaining reads non-redundant.

| Subagents | 3 (permission-sweep-auditor, risk-check-reviewer, qc-reviewer) |

**Rating:** Acceptable

**Findings:**
- session-notes.md read 4 times across session stages (Minor)
- session-plan.md Write failed on first attempt — file not Read before Write (Moderate)
- Mid-session compaction caused fresh-context re-orientation overhead (Minor)

**Recommendation:** Read session-plan.md before any Write attempt; enforce Read-before-Write discipline on log files touched at multiple stages.

**Estimated savings:** ~2,000–4,000 tokens if rework cycle and compaction re-orientation overhead eliminated.

- Settings files each read twice: first via Bash `cat` for context gathering, then again via Read tool to satisfy Edit's read-first requirement — 4 double-reads × ~85 lines avg = ~340 lines duplicated (Re-reads, Moderate)
- session-notes.md read 3 times across prime, session-plan precondition check, and wrap append-point find (Re-reads, Moderate)
- Write failed on first attempt because file was not Read before Write — required re-read and retry, adding at least 2 wasted tool calls (Rework, Moderate)
- Concurrent session wrote to session-notes.md between reads, causing an Edit conflict that forced another re-read before retry (Tool overhead, Minor)

**Recommendation:** Use Read tool (not Bash `cat`) for initial context-gathering on settings files — satisfies Edit's read-first requirement in one pass. Cache session-notes.md content across prime/session-plan/wrap rather than re-reading each time.

**Estimated savings:** ~3,700 tokens/session from eliminating double-reads (~37,000–74,000 over 10–20 sessions).
