- **Commands used:** /prime, /session-start, /session-plan, /wrap-session
- **Iterations:** 0
- **Decisions logged:** 0
- **QC cycles:** 0 (operator explicitly skipped /qc-pass on session plan and both bundles)

### 2026-04-28 — /triage and /recommend: precondition-check guardrails
- **Commands used:** /wrap-session (only slash command actually invoked; conversation explored /triage and /recommend as discussion subjects, and operator's natural-language "Proceed" mapped semantically to /recommend without invoking it as a slash)
- **Iterations:** 0 (no drafting — small infra edits only)
- **Decisions logged:** 1 (precondition-gate vs. rename)
- **QC cycles:** 1 (post-edit qc-reviewer on guardrail edits: GO, mechanical-mode rubric, all M-checks Clear, zero findings, zero fixes applied)
- **Gates:** 2 (1 changed, 1 confirmed) — plan-approval:changed (operator pivoted from rename discussion to guardrail design after I presented rename candidates), plan-approval:confirmed (operator approved guardrail proposal without revision via "Proceed")

- **Gates:** 2 (1 changed, 1 confirmed) — plan-approval:confirmed (operator picked Option A without revision), bright-line-review:changed (operator caught /fewer-permission-prompts under-delivery — "I had to approve like 8 permissions" — and directed broader allowlist scope)

Second /improve-skill run (prose-compliance-qc) skipped Step 3 iteration and Step 4 evaluator per operator — scope was too small to benefit from a formal evaluator gate; replaced by mechanical verification of the three known staleness points.
- **Gates:** 5 (5 confirmed) — plan-approval:confirmed (ai-prose-decontamination Step 1 understanding gate), content-review:confirmed (ai-prose-decontamination Step 7 results review), plan-approval:confirmed (mid-session scope extension to produce-prose-draft cleanup), plan-approval:confirmed (prose-compliance-qc streamlined-pipeline proposal), content-review:confirmed (prose-compliance-qc Option B — expand scope to all three staleness points)
