Usage: /deploy-workflow [project-name]

Initialize a new project from a workflow template. Handles copying, placeholder replacement, skill symlinks, git init, and initial commit.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` — optional project name in kebab-case (e.g., `market-entry-analysis`). If omitted, you will be asked.

---

## Step 1: Discover available templates

Scan for directories matching `workflows/*/` within the `ai-resources/` repo. Each subdirectory is an available workflow template.

- If **one template** found: auto-select it and tell the user which template you're using.
- If **multiple templates** found: list them and ask the user to pick one.
- If **none found**: stop and tell the user no templates are available.

Set `TEMPLATE_PATH` to the selected template directory (e.g., `ai-resources/workflows/research-workflow/`).
Set `WORKSPACE_ROOT` to the parent of the `ai-resources/` directory (the Axcíon AI workspace root containing `projects/`, etc.).

## Step 2: Get project name

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a project name, use it. Otherwise, ask the user for a kebab-case project name.

Validate: lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only. No spaces, no uppercase.

Set `PROJECT_NAME` to the validated name.
Set `PROJECT_DIR` to `{WORKSPACE_ROOT}/projects/{PROJECT_NAME}`.

Verify `{PROJECT_DIR}` does not already exist. If it does, stop and tell the user.

## Step 3: Copy template

```bash
cp -r {TEMPLATE_PATH}/ {PROJECT_DIR}/
```

Confirm the copy succeeded by checking `{PROJECT_DIR}/CLAUDE.md` exists.

## Step 4: Enrich with shared ai-resources features

Symlink shared commands and agents from `ai-resources/.claude/` into the deployed project. The template includes a **shared manifest** (`.claude/shared-manifest.json`) that declares which files are shared (symlinked to ai-resources) vs local (template-owned copies). A SessionStart hook (`auto-sync-shared.sh`) reads this manifest to auto-create missing symlinks on every session start — so new commands added to ai-resources appear in projects automatically.

### How it works

The manifest has two sections per category (`commands`, `agents`):
- **`local`** — template-owned files. Already in the project from Step 3. Never overwritten, never symlinked.
- **`shared`** — symlinked to ai-resources. Created here in Step 4, and auto-maintained by the SessionStart hook.

### Hooks

Hooks are always **copied** (not symlinked) because they may need project-specific paths. Hooks excluded from copying:

**Hooks:** `pre-commit`, `check-template-drift.sh`

### Enrichment logic

**Symlink path rule:** Always use **relative** symlinks so the workspace stays portable. From `projects/{name}/.claude/commands/` or `.claude/agents/`, the relative path back to `ai-resources/` is computed by counting directory levels between the symlink location and the workspace root. For the standard layout (`projects/{name}/.claude/commands/`), that's 4 levels up: `../../../../ai-resources/.claude/commands/{file}`. If a project is nested deeper or shallower, compute the correct depth — do not hardcode.

```bash
AI_RESOURCES="{WORKSPACE_ROOT}/ai-resources"
MANIFEST="{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/shared-manifest.json"

# Compute relative path from project .claude/commands/ to ai-resources .claude/commands/
# For projects/{name}/.claude/commands/ → ../../../../ai-resources/.claude/commands/
REL_CMD="$(python3 -c "import os; print(os.path.relpath('$AI_RESOURCES/.claude/commands', '{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/commands'))")"
REL_AGT="$(python3 -c "import os; print(os.path.relpath('$AI_RESOURCES/.claude/agents', '{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents'))")"

# Commands — symlink shared entries from manifest
mkdir -p "{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/commands"
for name in $(jq -r '.commands.shared[]' "$MANIFEST"); do
  src="$AI_RESOURCES/.claude/commands/${name}.md"
  target="{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/commands/${name}.md"
  [ -f "$src" ] || continue
  [ -e "$target" ] || [ -L "$target" ] && continue
  ln -s "$REL_CMD/${name}.md" "$target"
done

# Agents — symlink shared entries from manifest
mkdir -p "{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents"
for name in $(jq -r '.agents.shared[]' "$MANIFEST"); do
  src="$AI_RESOURCES/.claude/agents/${name}.md"
  target="{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/agents/${name}.md"
  [ -f "$src" ] || continue
  [ -e "$target" ] || [ -L "$target" ] && continue
  ln -s "$REL_AGT/${name}.md" "$target"
done

# Hooks (copy — not symlinked)
EXCLUDE_HOOKS="pre-commit check-template-drift.sh auto-sync-shared.sh"
mkdir -p "{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks"
for f in "$AI_RESOURCES/.claude/hooks/"*; do
  [ ! -f "$f" ] && continue
  name=$(basename "$f")
  echo "$EXCLUDE_HOOKS" | grep -qw "$name" && continue
  [ -f "{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/$name" ] && continue
  cp "$f" "{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/"
done
```

### Report what was added

After copying, report what was enriched:

```
Enriched project with shared features from ai-resources:
  Commands added: [list names]
  Agents added: [list names]
  Hooks added: [list names]
  Skipped (already in template): [list names]
```

If nothing was added (template already has everything), say so.

### Hooks and settings.json

Hooks require corresponding entries in `.claude/settings.json` to be active. The template's `settings.json` already registers its own hooks. If a copied hook has no `settings.json` entry, warn the operator:

> "Hook {name} was copied but has no entry in `.claude/settings.json`. It will not fire until registered. Add it manually or run `/sync-workflow` after deployment."

Do NOT auto-modify `settings.json` — hook registration requires knowing the matcher, event type, and timeout, which varies per hook. To make the gap visible, emit the canonical hook-registration checklist below so the operator can copy the right entries into the deployed project's `settings.json`.

> **Append-only side effect.** Some hooks append entries to `<project>/logs/friction-log.md` and `logs/improvement-log.md` when they fire. Reverting the hook scripts leaves prior log entries in deployed projects — manual cleanup required per project.

#### Canonical hook-registration checklist

Generated dynamically from `ai-resources/.claude/settings.json` so the list stays in sync with the source of truth. Run after the hooks-copy step (Step 4 enrichment logic) and before reporting "Project ready".

```bash
AI_SETTINGS="$AI_RESOURCES/.claude/settings.json"
if [ -f "$AI_SETTINGS" ]; then
  echo ""
  echo "Hook-registration checklist (add to {PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/settings.json as needed):"
  echo ""
  jq -r '
    .hooks // {}
    | to_entries[]
    | .key as $event
    | .value[]
    | (.matcher // null) as $matcher
    | .hooks[]
    | ((.command | [scan("[^/\\s]+\\.sh")] | last) // .command) as $base
    | (.timeout // 5) as $timeout
    | "  \($base) → \($event)\(if $matcher then "[\($matcher)]" else "" end) (timeout \($timeout))"
  ' "$AI_SETTINGS"
  echo ""
  echo "Skip any hook that is not relevant to this project's workflow."
fi
```

### Ensure permissions baseline in deployed settings.json

**Scope note.** This sub-step only touches `.permissions` in the deployed `{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/settings.json`. Hook registration remains a manual operator step per the paragraph above.

**When it runs.** After Step 3's `cp -r` brings the template over, and **before** Step 7's placeholder replacement (and Step 5's placeholder discovery), so no `{{...}}` tokens can be introduced into the JSON by this sub-step and the merged `permissions` block cannot be invalidated by a later `sed` pass.

**Why it exists.** Without a `permissions` block in the deployed settings, Claude Code prompts the operator to approve every Edit/Write/Grep/Bash call in the new project. This sub-step guarantees a tool-permissions baseline even if the template itself ships without one.

**Requires `jq` on PATH.** If `jq` is not available, stop and report the missing dependency. Do not splice JSON at the string level.

**Predicate — "already has a permissions allowlist":** parsed JSON has `.permissions.allow` *and* that array is non-empty. If true, leave `permissions` alone. Otherwise merge the canonical block below.

**Canonical permissions block** (mirrors `allow` / `deny` from the operator's user-level `~/.claude/settings.json`, plus a narrow archival `Read(...)` deny set; `additionalDirectories` is intentionally omitted as a user-level absolute-path concern). The `Read(...)` denies target archival-only paths that no active command routinely reads. Per the workspace `## Applying Audit Recommendations` rule, these four entries are the safe universal set. Project-shape-specific denies (e.g., `Read(output/**)`, `Read(reports/**)`) are **not** included — add per-project after validating no active command reads from them.

```json
{
  "allow": [
    "Bash(*)",
    "Read",
    "Edit",
    "Write",
    "MultiEdit",
    "Agent",
    "Skill",
    "TodoWrite",
    "Glob",
    "Grep",
    "WebFetch",
    "WebSearch",
    "NotebookEdit",
    "ToolSearch"
  ],
  "deny": [
    "Bash(git push*)",
    "Bash(rm -rf *)",
    "Bash(sudo *)",
    "Read(archive/**)",
    "Read(**/*.archive.*)",
    "Read(**/deprecated/**)",
    "Read(**/old/**)"
  ]
}
```

**Canonical model default.** The merge procedure below also sets `"model": "sonnet[1m]"` at the top level of `settings.json` if unset, establishing Sonnet 1M as the per-turn default (the `[1m]` suffix forces 1M context; bare `sonnet` resolves to 200k). Per-project overrides go in `.claude/settings.local.json` per the project's Model Selection section.

**Merge procedure:**

```bash
command -v jq >/dev/null || { echo "ERROR: jq required for permissions merge"; exit 1; }

SETTINGS="{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/settings.json"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$SETTINGS")"
[ -f "$SETTINGS" ] || echo '{}' > "$SETTINGS"

CANONICAL_PERMS='{"allow":["Bash(*)","Read","Edit","Write","MultiEdit","Agent","Skill","TodoWrite","Glob","Grep","WebFetch","WebSearch","NotebookEdit","ToolSearch"],"deny":["Bash(git push*)","Bash(rm -rf *)","Bash(sudo *)","Read(archive/**)","Read(**/*.archive.*)","Read(**/deprecated/**)","Read(**/old/**)"]}'

jq --argjson perms "$CANONICAL_PERMS" '
  (if (.permissions.allow // []) | length > 0 then . else .permissions = $perms end)
  | (if (.model // "") == "" then .model = "sonnet[1m]" else . end)
' "$SETTINGS" > "$SETTINGS.tmp" && mv "$SETTINGS.tmp" "$SETTINGS"
```

Report in the enrichment output whether `permissions` was added or already present, and whether `model: sonnet[1m]` was added or already present.

**Interaction with the research-workflow template.** The template's own `settings.json` already carries a `permissions` block (added alongside this change), so on a fresh deploy the predicate returns true and this sub-step is a no-op. The sub-step remains load-bearing for (a) any future template that ships without a `permissions` block and (b) running `/sync-workflow` on older projects that were deployed before the template fix landed.

### Grant ai-resources filesystem visibility

**Scope note.** This sub-step only touches `.permissions.additionalDirectories` in `{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/settings.json`. It runs **unconditionally** — not gated by the allowlist predicate — so projects whose templates ship a narrower `permissions.allow` still receive the workspace-root grant they need to read from `ai-resources/` siblings at runtime.

**Why this is separate from the permissions merge above.** `additionalDirectories` grants *read access to paths outside the current project*, which is a different concern from tool permissions inside the project. Every deployed project needs to read from `ai-resources/` regardless of how narrow its tool allowlist is, so this grant is universal.

**Compute the workspace root** by walking upward from `{PROJECT_DIR}` until an ancestor contains `ai-resources/` (mirrors the idiom in `auto-sync-shared.sh`). Use an absolute path — Claude Code resolves `additionalDirectories` relative to session CWD, which varies by how the project is opened.

```bash
command -v jq >/dev/null || { echo "ERROR: jq required for additionalDirectories merge"; exit 1; }

SETTINGS="{PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/settings.json"
[ -f "$SETTINGS" ] || echo '{}' > "$SETTINGS"

d="$(cd {PROJECT_DIR} && pwd)"
WORKSPACE=""
while [ "$d" != "/" ]; do
  d=$(dirname "$d")
  [ -d "$d/ai-resources" ] && WORKSPACE="$d" && break
done
[ -n "$WORKSPACE" ] || { echo "WARN: ai-resources not found in any ancestor — skipping additionalDirectories grant"; }

if [ -n "$WORKSPACE" ]; then
  jq --arg dir "$WORKSPACE" \
    '.permissions.additionalDirectories = ((.permissions.additionalDirectories // [] | map(select(startswith("{{") | not))) + [$dir] | unique)' \
    "$SETTINGS" > "$SETTINGS.tmp" && mv "$SETTINGS.tmp" "$SETTINGS"
fi
```

`unique` makes this idempotent. The `map(select(...))` strip removes any `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` entries from the template before appending the real workspace path. Report whether the workspace root was added or already present.

## Step 5: Discover placeholders

Scan all files in `{PROJECT_DIR}/` for `{{...}}` patterns. Collect the unique placeholder names.

```bash
grep -roh '{{[A-Z_]*}}' {PROJECT_DIR}/ | sort -u
```

For each placeholder, check if `{PROJECT_DIR}/SETUP.md` exists and contains a description for it (look in the Placeholder Reference table or the step descriptions). Build a list of placeholders with their descriptions.

Display the list to the user:
```
Found N placeholders to fill:
- {{PLACEHOLDER_1}} — description from SETUP.md (or "no description available")
- {{PLACEHOLDER_2}} — description
...
```

## Step 6: Collect placeholder values [Operator]

Ask the user to provide values for all placeholders. Present them as a group so the user can provide all values at once, or go one by one — follow the user's preference.

For `{{OPERATOR_NAME}}`: default to the git user's first name if available (`git config user.name`). Tell the user the default and let them confirm or override.

## Step 7: Replace placeholders

For each placeholder, replace all occurrences across all files in `{PROJECT_DIR}/`:

```bash
find {PROJECT_DIR}/ -type f -name "*.md" -o -name "*.json" | xargs sed -i '' 's/{{PLACEHOLDER}}/value/g'
```

Be careful with sed special characters in values — escape `/`, `&`, and `\` in replacement strings.

After replacement, verify no `{{...}}` patterns remain:

```bash
grep -r '{{' {PROJECT_DIR}/ --include="*.md" --include="*.json"
```

If any remain, report them and ask the user for the missing values.

## Step 8: Create skill symlinks (conditional)

Only run this step if `{PROJECT_DIR}/reference/skills/` exists.

```bash
SKILLS_DIR="{WORKSPACE_ROOT}/ai-resources/skills"

for skill in "$SKILLS_DIR"/*/; do
  skill_name=$(basename "$skill")
  # Skip if a local copy already exists
  [ -d "{PROJECT_DIR}/reference/skills/$skill_name" ] && continue
  ln -s "$skill" "{PROJECT_DIR}/reference/skills/$skill_name"
done
```

Verify: list the created symlinks and confirm they resolve.

If `{WORKSPACE_ROOT}/ai-resources/skills/` does not exist, skip this step and warn the user that skills will need to be linked manually.

## Step 9: Initialize git

```bash
cd {PROJECT_DIR}
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "init: {PROJECT_NAME} workspace from research template"
```

## Step 10: Remove SETUP.md from project

The setup checklist has been completed — it should not remain in the deployed project.

```bash
cd {PROJECT_DIR}
git rm SETUP.md
git commit -m "remove setup checklist (setup complete)"
```

## Step 11: Validate

Run a quick validation:

1. Confirm no `{{...}}` placeholders remain in any `.md` or `.json` file.
2. Confirm all symlinks in `reference/skills/` resolve (if the directory exists).
3. Confirm `CLAUDE.md` exists and has at least one heading.
4. Confirm `.claude/settings.json` is valid JSON (if it exists).

Report the validation results. If all pass:

```
Project ready at: {PROJECT_DIR}

Next steps:
1. Open Claude Code in {PROJECT_DIR}/
2. Run /status to verify the project loads correctly
3. Create your first task plan draft in preparation/task-plans/
4. Run /run-preparation to begin Stage 1
```

If any validation fails, report what failed and suggest how to fix it.
