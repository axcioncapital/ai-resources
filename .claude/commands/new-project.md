# /new-project — Project Pipeline Orchestrator

You are the orchestrator for Axcíon's project pipeline. This pipeline discovers approved planning artifacts (context pack, project plan, optional technical spec) from the `projects/project-planning/` workspace and produces a fully configured Claude Code setup through a series of staged gates, starting at Stage 3a (Repo Snapshot).

## Scope Validation

This pipeline is for **any Axcíon project that requires Claude Code** — whether that's building AI resources (skills, workflows, agents), setting up a research project, configuring a new workspace, or any other project where Claude Code is the execution environment. Before doing anything else, check whether the user's input describes work that will be built or run through Claude Code. If not, stop and explain that this pipeline is for Claude Code-based projects.

**CWD guard:** Check if the current working directory is the `ai-resources` repo itself (i.e., the CWD contains a `skills/` directory and a `CLAUDE.md` with "Axcion AI Resource Repository" at the root level). If so, stop and tell the user:

> "This command should be run from a project repo or the Axcíon AI workspace root, not from ai-resources directly. Open your target repo and run `/new-project` from there."

**Note:** Running from the Axcíon AI workspace root (the parent directory that contains `ai-resources/`, `projects/`, etc.) is valid — the guard only blocks running from inside `ai-resources/` itself.

## Pre-Flight Validation

Before starting the pipeline, verify all required agent files exist in `ai-resources/.claude/agents/`:
- `pipeline-stage-3a.md`, `pipeline-stage-3b.md`, `pipeline-stage-3c.md`, `pipeline-stage-4.md`, `pipeline-stage-5.md`, `session-guide-generator.md`

Check with: `ls ai-resources/.claude/agents/pipeline-stage-*.md ai-resources/.claude/agents/session-guide-generator.md 2>&1`

If ANY file is missing, list all missing files and stop. Do not start the pipeline.

## Planning Artifact Requirement

Planning artifacts (context pack, project plan, optional technical spec) are produced upstream in the `projects/project-planning/` workspace via `/plan-draft` → `/plan-refine` → `/plan-evaluate` (and the equivalent spec cycle). The `/new-project` pipeline consumes approved artifacts from `projects/project-planning/output/{project-name}/` — it does not accept ad-hoc context packs pasted into the conversation.

**If the planning artifacts do not exist for a given project name, stop and direct the operator to run the planning workflow first.** See First Run step 3 below for the exact abort message.

## First Run vs. Continuation

**Determine which mode you're in:**

1. Look for `projects/*/pipeline/pipeline-state.md` files first. If none found, fall back to `projects/*/pipeline-state.md` (legacy layout).
2. If no pipeline state files exist → **First Run**
3. If pipeline state files exist → **Continuation** (if multiple projects have pipeline state files, ask the user which project to resume). Note whether the state file is in `pipeline/` (new layout) or at root (legacy layout) — use the same layout for all subsequent artifact paths in that project.

### First Run

1. **Ask for the project name.** Use lowercase-with-hyphens format (e.g., `context-aware-skill-router`). The name must match the directory name in `projects/project-planning/output/`.

2. **Locate the planning workspace.** Walk upward from the current working directory until an ancestor contains `projects/project-planning/`. Use the absolute path — Claude Code resolves paths relative to session CWD, which varies. The walk idiom mirrors the one used to locate `ai-resources/` in post-pipeline enrichment (see step 3 further down).

   ```bash
   d="$(pwd)"
   PLANNING_WORKSPACE=""
   while [ "$d" != "/" ]; do
     if [ -d "$d/projects/project-planning" ]; then PLANNING_WORKSPACE="$d"; break; fi
     d=$(dirname "$d")
   done
   [ -n "$PLANNING_WORKSPACE" ] || { echo "ERROR: projects/project-planning/ not found in any ancestor of $(pwd). Cannot locate planning artifacts."; exit 1; }
   ```

3. **Verify the planning output directory exists** at `$PLANNING_WORKSPACE/projects/project-planning/output/{project-name}/`. If not, stop with:

   > "No planning artifacts found at `projects/project-planning/output/{project-name}/`. Run `/plan-draft`, `/plan-refine`, `/plan-evaluate` (and optionally the spec cycle via `/spec-draft`, `/spec-refine`, `/spec-evaluate`) in the project-planning workspace first, then re-run `/new-project`."

4. **Discover artifacts** inside `$PLANNING_WORKSPACE/projects/project-planning/output/{project-name}/`:

   ```bash
   SRC="$PLANNING_WORKSPACE/projects/project-planning/output/{project-name}"

   # Context pack — required
   [ -f "$SRC/context-pack.md" ] || { echo "ERROR: $SRC/context-pack.md not found. Cannot proceed."; exit 1; }

   # Latest project-plan — required. sort -V handles v10+ correctly (ls -v is GNU-only, not portable to macOS BSD).
   LATEST_PLAN=$(ls "$SRC"/project-plan-v*.md 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -n 1)
   [ -n "$LATEST_PLAN" ] || { echo "ERROR: No project-plan-v*.md in $SRC. Cannot proceed."; exit 1; }

   # Latest tech-spec — optional
   LATEST_SPEC=$(ls "$SRC"/tech-spec-v*.md 2>/dev/null | sort -V | tail -n 1)

   # QC verdicts — advisory. Match both double-bold (**PASS**) and single-bold (PASS-WITH-FINDINGS) forms.
   if [ -f "$SRC/plan-qc-verdict.md" ]; then
     grep -qE "^\*\*Verdict:\*\*\s+\**PASS" "$SRC/plan-qc-verdict.md" || echo "WARN: plan-qc-verdict.md does not show PASS — proceeding anyway; confirm v{n} is the approved version."
   else
     echo "WARN: plan-qc-verdict.md missing — proceeding anyway; confirm the project plan is approved."
   fi
   if [ -n "$LATEST_SPEC" ] && [ -f "$SRC/spec-qc-verdict.md" ]; then
     grep -qE "^\*\*Verdict:\*\*\s+\**PASS" "$SRC/spec-qc-verdict.md" || echo "WARN: spec-qc-verdict.md does not show PASS — proceeding anyway; confirm v{n} is the approved version."
   fi
   ```

   QC verdict checks are advisory-only: if a verdict is missing or non-PASS, emit a warning and continue. Hard-blocking on a missing verdict file (e.g., operator deleted it while iterating) would create false-abort friction; the operator gate-keeps the planning workflow itself.

5. **Ask for the GitHub repository link.** The user should provide the URL of the project's GitHub repo (e.g., `https://github.com/axcion-ai/project-name`).

6. **Create the project directory** at `projects/{project-name}/` and the pipeline artifact subdirectory at `projects/{project-name}/pipeline/`.

7. **Copy the discovered artifacts** into the target pipeline directory at canonical names (downstream stages read canonical paths):

   ```bash
   cp "$SRC/context-pack.md"   "projects/{project-name}/pipeline/context-pack.md"
   cp "$LATEST_PLAN"            "projects/{project-name}/pipeline/project-plan.md"
   [ -n "$LATEST_SPEC" ] && cp "$LATEST_SPEC" "projects/{project-name}/pipeline/technical-spec.md"
   ```

8. **Write `projects/{project-name}/pipeline/sources.md`** to record provenance (satisfies the workspace "legitimate copying" exception: downstream tool requires canonical path, source recorded):

   ```markdown
   # Pipeline Input Sources — {project-name}

   | Canonical path | Source path | Source version | Copied on |
   |----------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
   | pipeline/context-pack.md | {abs-source-path}/context-pack.md | — | {YYYY-MM-DD} |
   | pipeline/project-plan.md | {abs-source-path}/project-plan-v{n}.md | v{n} | {YYYY-MM-DD} |
   | pipeline/technical-spec.md | {abs-source-path}/tech-spec-v{n}.md | v{n} | {YYYY-MM-DD} |
   ```

   Omit the `technical-spec.md` row if no tech spec was discovered.

9. **Create `projects/{project-name}/pipeline/decisions.md`** with this template:

```markdown
# Decisions — {project-name}

| # | Stage | Decision | Rationale | Decided By |
|---|-------|----------|-----------|------------|
```

10. **Create `projects/{project-name}/pipeline/pipeline-state.md`** to track pipeline progress:

```markdown
# Pipeline State — {project-name}

## Metadata
- **GitHub:** {github-url}
- **Planning source:** projects/project-planning/output/{project-name}/

| Stage | Status | Artifact |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 3a — Repo Snapshot | in_progress | — |
| 3b — Architecture Design | pending | — |
| 3c — Implementation Spec | pending | — |
| 4 — Implementation | pending | — |
| 5 — Testing | pending | — |
| 6 — Session Guide | pending | — |
```

11. **Announce what was discovered and copied.** Include: source directory, picked versions (e.g., `project-plan-v3.md`), whether a tech spec was found, any QC-verdict warnings. State that Stage 3a is starting. No separate confirmation gate before copy — the announcement names every file, `sources.md` records provenance, and any wrong picks are reversible via the existing `ABORT` gate.

11a. **Scaffold the project's Model Selection section.** Every project declares its own default model. Ask the operator one question:

    > Project task profile?
    > (a) Heavy execution → Sonnet 1M (`claude-sonnet-4-6[1m]`) default. Most repo work, KB ops, operational projects.
    > (b) Heavy judgment → Opus 4.7 (`claude-opus-4-7`) default. Plan/spec drafting, identity drafting, strategic projects.
    > (c) Mixed → Sonnet 1M default with Opus opt-ins. Most projects; commands/agents declare `model: opus` where judgment is needed.

    **Pre-flight identifier verification.** Before writing the chosen identifier into the project CLAUDE.md, confirm the canonical strings against a live source: read `projects/buy-side-service-plan/CLAUDE.md` for the Opus 4.7 form, and the system-prompt model context for the Sonnet 4.6 1M form. If any string fails to match the precedent, abort scaffolding and surface the discrepancy — do not write a non-resolvable model ID into a new project. Sonnet identifiers must include the `[1m]` suffix to force 1M context (bare `claude-sonnet-4-6` resolves to 200k).

    **Append a `Model Selection` section to `projects/{project-name}/CLAUDE.md`** (insert just before any `## Commit Rules` section, or before the final section if no Commit Rules section exists). Format matching the buy-side-service-plan precedent:

    ```
    ## Model Selection

    Default model for this project is {Sonnet 1M | Opus 4.7} (`{full-form identifier}`, set in `.claude/settings.local.json`, which is gitignored — each operator applies the default manually per machine). Reason: {one-line rationale tied to the chosen profile}. {Optional: one line about which commands/agents opt out of the default and why.}.
    ```

    Confirm the section was written by reading the file back and showing the operator the appended text. Do not write `.claude/settings.local.json` automatically — that is a per-operator manual step (gitignored).

12. **Spawn the Stage 3a subagent** (`pipeline-stage-3a`). Include in the spawn prompt: "Project directory: projects/{project-name}/ — Pipeline directory: projects/{project-name}/pipeline/"

### Continuation

1. Read the pipeline state file for the project.
2. Find the stage that is `in_progress`, or the first `pending` stage whose predecessor is `completed` (or `skipped`).
3. Announce: "Resuming pipeline at [stage name]. Last completed: [previous stage]."
4. Spawn the corresponding stage subagent. Include in the spawn prompt: "Project directory: projects/{project-name}/ — Pipeline directory: projects/{project-name}/pipeline/"

**Agent name mapping:** Stages 3a–5 use the `pipeline-stage-{N}` naming convention. Stage 6 (Session Guide) uses the `session-guide-generator` agent instead.

**Legacy pipeline-state migration.** If a pipeline-state.md still lists Stage 2 or 2.5 as `in_progress` or `pending` (from before this change), stop and tell the operator they have two options: (a) manually edit the state file to remove those rows and set Stage 3a to `in_progress` (confirming the project's plan and tech spec exist in `projects/project-planning/output/{name}/`), or (b) abandon the in-progress pipeline and re-run `/new-project` from scratch. Do not auto-migrate.

## Gate Protocol

After each stage subagent completes:

1. Update `pipeline-state.md`: set the current stage to `completed` and record the artifact path.
2. Wait for the user's command:
   - **`NEXT`** → Set the next stage to `in_progress` in `pipeline-state.md`. If context has grown from the prior stage, suggest `▸ /compact` before spawning. Spawn the next stage subagent.
   - **`SKIP`** → Valid after Stage 5 only (skips Stage 6 — marks it `skipped`, announces pipeline complete). Not valid at other stages.
   - **`ABORT`** → Mark all remaining `pending` stages as `cancelled` in `pipeline-state.md`. Announce abort. Do not delete project artifacts.

## Post-Stage 5 Behavior

After Stage 5 completes successfully, announce:

> "Pipeline core stages complete. Say NEXT to generate a Session Guide (Stage 6 — a step-by-step execution playbook for running this project), SKIP to finish the pipeline without one, or ABORT to cancel."

If the user says NEXT, spawn the `session-guide-generator` agent. If SKIP, mark Stage 6 as `skipped` and announce the pipeline is complete. After Stage 6 completes (or is skipped), announce: "Pipeline complete. All artifacts saved to projects/{project-name}/."

Then remind the operator:

> **Next steps:** Run `/repo-dd` and `/analyze-workflow` against the new project to establish a baseline audit and infrastructure inventory.

## Error Handling

If a stage subagent reports failure:
- Do NOT update the stage to `completed` in `pipeline-state.md`
- Report the failure to the user
- Offer options: retry the stage, abort the pipeline, or fix manually and resume

## Post-Pipeline Enrichment

After the pipeline completes (all stages done or final stage skipped), set the project up for **ongoing** sync with ai-resources. The mechanism is the SessionStart hook `ai-resources/.claude/hooks/auto-sync-shared.sh`, which symlinks every command/agent in `ai-resources/.claude/{commands,agents}/` into the project on session start, except files declared as project-local in the manifest and a small baked-in meta exclusion list. New commands added to ai-resources after this point flow into the project automatically — no re-enrichment needed.

### What to install

If a `.claude/shared-manifest.json` already exists in the project (created by a workflow template via `/deploy-workflow`), do nothing — the workflow template already wired everything up. Skip to the "Report" step.

Otherwise, install the three pieces:

1. **`projects/{name}/.claude/shared-manifest.json`** — declares project-owned files. Identify which commands and agents this project created locally during the pipeline (pipeline-specific commands, project-specific evaluator agents, etc.) and list them under `commands.local` / `agents.local`. Anything not listed will be auto-synced from ai-resources. Template:

   ```json
   {
     "_doc": "Lists project-owned files under .local. The auto-sync hook symlinks every other file from ai-resources/.claude/{commands,agents}/ on session start.",
     "commands": { "local": [ ... ] },
     "agents": { "local": [ ... ] }
   }
   ```

2. **`projects/{name}/.claude/settings.json`** — wire the SessionStart hook **and** ensure the project inherits a tool-permissions baseline so the operator does not get approval prompts on routine Edit/Write/Grep calls.

   **Requires `jq` on PATH.** If `jq` is not available, stop and report the missing dependency — do not attempt string-level JSON manipulation.

   **Canonical permissions block** (mirrors `ai-resources/docs/permission-template.md` Layer D). Three structural additions compared to the pre-2026-04-24 template, driven by four root causes surfaced in the permission-sweep design doc:

   - `"defaultMode": "bypassPermissions"` — without this, projects default to prompt-on-allow regardless of their allow list (the primary cause of recurring Edit/Delete prompts).
   - `Edit(**/.claude/**)` and `Write(**/.claude/**)` — `**` globs do not match dotfile path components by default, so broad `Edit(X/**)` rules leave nested `.claude/` paths uncovered.
   - `Bash(rm *)` — narrow `rm` in allow (destructive `rm -rf` stays on deny). Fixes Delete/Remove prompts.

   Note: `additionalDirectories` is **not** included in this canonical block because each project's entry is computed dynamically at enrichment time — see step 3 below, which adds the ai-resources workspace root via a separate jq merge so projects with existing `permissions.allow` arrays (which skip this canonical merge) still receive the grant.

   The `Read(...)` denies target archival-only paths that no active command routinely reads. Per the workspace `## Applying Audit Recommendations` rule, these four entries are the safe universal set. Project-shape-specific denies (e.g., `Read(output/**)`, `Read(reports/**)`) are **not** included in the canonical block — they should be added per-project after confirming no active command reads from them.

   ```json
   {
     "defaultMode": "bypassPermissions",
     "allow": [
       "Bash(*)",
       "Read",
       "Edit",
       "Write",
       "MultiEdit",
       "Agent",
       "Skill",
       "TodoWrite",
       "Glob",
       "Grep",
       "WebFetch",
       "WebSearch",
       "NotebookEdit",
       "ToolSearch",
       "Edit(**/.claude/**)",
       "Write(**/.claude/**)",
       "Bash(rm *)"
     ],
     "deny": [
       "Bash(git push*)",
       "Bash(rm -rf *)",
       "Bash(sudo *)",
       "Read(archive/**)",
       "Read(**/*.archive.*)",
       "Read(**/deprecated/**)",
       "Read(**/old/**)"
     ]
   }
   ```

   **Auto-sync SessionStart hook entry** (added to `hooks.SessionStart`):

   ```json
   {
     "type": "command",
     "command": "d=\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"; while [ \"$d\" != '/' ]; do d=$(dirname \"$d\"); [ -x \"$d/ai-resources/.claude/hooks/auto-sync-shared.sh\" ] && { \"$d/ai-resources/.claude/hooks/auto-sync-shared.sh\"; exit; }; done",
     "timeout": 10,
     "statusMessage": "Syncing shared commands from ai-resources..."
   }
   ```

   **Permission-sanity SessionStart hook entry** (added to `hooks.SessionStart`) — surfaces a nudge when the project's `settings.json` or `settings.local.json` lacks `defaultMode: "bypassPermissions"`, the primary cause of recurring Edit/Delete permission prompts:

   ```json
   {
     "type": "command",
     "command": "d=\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"; while [ \"$d\" != '/' ]; do d=$(dirname \"$d\"); [ -x \"$d/ai-resources/.claude/hooks/check-permission-sanity.sh\" ] && { \"$d/ai-resources/.claude/hooks/check-permission-sanity.sh\"; exit; }; done",
     "timeout": 5,
     "statusMessage": "Permission sanity check..."
   }
   ```

   Both hooks are invoked **directly from ai-resources** — do not copy the scripts into the project's hooks directory.

   **Predicate for "already has a permissions allowlist":** parsed JSON has `.permissions.allow` *and* that array is non-empty. If true, leave `permissions` alone (protects projects that intentionally have a narrower block). Otherwise, merge the canonical block in.

   **Merge procedure:**

   ```bash
   command -v jq >/dev/null || { echo "ERROR: jq required for permissions merge"; exit 1; }

   SETTINGS="projects/{name}/.claude/settings.json"
   mkdir -p "$(dirname "$SETTINGS")"
   [ -f "$SETTINGS" ] || echo '{}' > "$SETTINGS"

   CANONICAL_PERMS='{"defaultMode":"bypassPermissions","allow":["Bash(*)","Read","Edit","Write","MultiEdit","Agent","Skill","TodoWrite","Glob","Grep","WebFetch","WebSearch","NotebookEdit","ToolSearch","Edit(**/.claude/**)","Write(**/.claude/**)","Bash(rm *)"],"deny":["Bash(git push*)","Bash(rm -rf *)","Bash(sudo *)","Read(archive/**)","Read(**/*.archive.*)","Read(**/deprecated/**)","Read(**/old/**)"]}'

   AUTO_SYNC_HOOK='{"type":"command","command":"d=\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"; while [ \"$d\" != '"'"'/'"'"' ]; do d=$(dirname \"$d\"); [ -x \"$d/ai-resources/.claude/hooks/auto-sync-shared.sh\" ] && { \"$d/ai-resources/.claude/hooks/auto-sync-shared.sh\"; exit; }; done","timeout":10,"statusMessage":"Syncing shared commands from ai-resources..."}'

   SANITY_HOOK='{"type":"command","command":"d=\"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\"; while [ \"$d\" != '"'"'/'"'"' ]; do d=$(dirname \"$d\"); [ -x \"$d/ai-resources/.claude/hooks/check-permission-sanity.sh\" ] && { \"$d/ai-resources/.claude/hooks/check-permission-sanity.sh\"; exit; }; done","timeout":5,"statusMessage":"Permission sanity check..."}'

   jq --argjson perms "$CANONICAL_PERMS" --argjson sync "$AUTO_SYNC_HOOK" --argjson sanity "$SANITY_HOOK" '
     (if (.permissions.allow // []) | length > 0 then . else .permissions = $perms end)
     | .hooks = (.hooks // {})
     | .hooks.SessionStart = (.hooks.SessionStart // [])
     | (if (.hooks.SessionStart | any(.hooks? // [.] | .[]? | .command == $sync.command))
        then .
        else .hooks.SessionStart += [{"hooks":[$sync]}]
        end)
     | (if (.hooks.SessionStart | any(.hooks? // [.] | .[]? | .command == $sanity.command))
        then .
        else .hooks.SessionStart += [{"hooks":[$sanity]}]
        end)
   ' "$SETTINGS" > "$SETTINGS.tmp" && mv "$SETTINGS.tmp" "$SETTINGS"
   ```

   Report in the step output:
   - whether `permissions` was added, already present, or skipped
   - whether the auto-sync SessionStart hook was added or already present
   - whether the permission-sanity SessionStart hook was added or already present

3. **Grant ai-resources filesystem visibility** — Claude Code sandboxes each project to its own directory by default. Shared skills under `ai-resources/skills/` and symlinks into `ai-resources/.claude/{commands,agents}/` are unreachable until the workspace root is added to `permissions.additionalDirectories` in the project's `.claude/settings.json`. This step performs that grant.

   The walk to locate the workspace root mirrors the idiom in `ai-resources/.claude/hooks/auto-sync-shared.sh` (walk upward until an ancestor contains `ai-resources/`). Use an absolute path, not a relative one — Claude Code resolves `additionalDirectories` relative to session CWD, which varies by how the project is opened.

   **Load-bearing jq semantics:** for projects where step 2 skipped the permissions merge (because `.permissions.allow` was already non-empty) OR for projects where step 2 added the canonical block without `additionalDirectories`, jq's `=` operator on the leaf path `.permissions.additionalDirectories` synthesizes any missing parent objects automatically. This is the only reason a single idempotent jq call is sufficient here — if jq is ever replaced with another tool (Python, Node, yq), that tool must do the same parent-object auto-creation.

   ```bash
   command -v jq >/dev/null || { echo "ERROR: jq required for additionalDirectories merge"; exit 1; }

   SETTINGS="projects/{name}/.claude/settings.json"
   [ -f "$SETTINGS" ] || echo '{}' > "$SETTINGS"

   d="$(cd projects/{name} && pwd)"
   WORKSPACE=""
   while [ "$d" != "/" ]; do
     d=$(dirname "$d")
     [ -d "$d/ai-resources" ] && WORKSPACE="$d" && break
   done
   [ -n "$WORKSPACE" ] || { echo "WARN: ai-resources not found in any ancestor — skipping additionalDirectories grant"; }

   if [ -n "$WORKSPACE" ]; then
     jq --arg dir "$WORKSPACE" \
       '.permissions.additionalDirectories = ((.permissions.additionalDirectories // [] | map(select(startswith("{{") | not))) + [$dir] | unique)' \
       "$SETTINGS" > "$SETTINGS.tmp" && mv "$SETTINGS.tmp" "$SETTINGS"
   fi
   ```

   Report in the step output:
   - whether `additionalDirectories` was added, already present, or skipped (walk failed)
   - the absolute workspace path that was added

4. **`projects/{name}/CLAUDE.md`** — ensure the project CLAUDE.md contains four canonical sections: `## Input File Handling`, `## Commit Rules`, `## Compaction`, and `## Session Boundaries`. These guarantee that projects opened without the parent workspace CLAUDE.md loaded still see the load-bearing behavioral rules.

   Each section is a short-form mirror — not a verbatim copy of the workspace-level text — so it satisfies the workspace `## CLAUDE.md Scoping` rule ("short pointer acceptable; verbatim duplication is not") while preserving the 2026-04-13 "Commit Rules propagate by explicit copy" decision (inheritance alone proved unreliable in practice, so the rule must appear in-context).

   **Policy (per section, applied independently):**
   - If `projects/{name}/CLAUDE.md` does not exist → create a minimal one with a project title (use the project name) and all four canonical blocks below. Substitute `{name}` (project name) and `{project-description}` (one-line description from the pipeline's context pack, or a generic placeholder if absent) before executing the bash block — the heredoc uses quoted `<<'EOF'`, so no shell expansion happens at runtime.
   - If `projects/{name}/CLAUDE.md` exists and already contains a given heading → leave that section alone. Report "{section} already present, skipping."
   - If `projects/{name}/CLAUDE.md` exists but has no given heading → append that canonical block to the end of the file (preserving the existing content verbatim, preceded by a blank line).

   **Canonical Commit Rules block** (copy verbatim):

   ```markdown
   ## Commit Rules

   **Commit directly. Do not ask for permission.** After completing approved work, stage the relevant files and commit in a single step using a heredoc commit message. Do not run `git status`, `git diff`, or `git status --short` as pre-commit checks or post-commit verification — the filesystem is the source of truth for what you just changed.

   Do not push. Pushing is a manual operator step. After committing, remind the operator to push and to run `/wrap-session` if the work is complete. Never commit files that may contain secrets (`.env`, credentials, tokens).

   This rule mirrors the canonical `Commit behavior` section in the workspace-level `CLAUDE.md`. It is repeated here because projects are sometimes opened without the parent workspace context loaded.
   ```

   **Canonical Input File Handling block** (copy verbatim):

   ```markdown
   ## Input File Handling

   Input files — context packs, reference documents, source data, prior artifacts the operator drops into the working directory — are read-only references. Use them by path, do not copy or rewrite them.

   - **Default to `Read`.** When the operator points you at an input file (whether it lives in the project folder, an `inputs/` sibling, or an absolute path elsewhere on the filesystem), use the `Read` tool against that path. Never invoke `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, or shell file-creation commands (`cp`, `cat >`, `tee`, redirection, `install`, etc.) against a file whose content originated outside the current session.
   - **Do not materialize chat content.** If an input's content enters the conversation (pasted, quoted, or summarized), that does not make the chat copy canonical. The file on disk remains the source of truth.
   - **Do not co-locate inputs with outputs for "provenance."** If provenance matters, record the absolute path of the input in the artifact's frontmatter or a `sources.md` file — do not duplicate the bytes.
   - **Outputs are different.** Artifacts your command is *designed to produce* (plans, specs, drafts, reports) are written normally via `Write` into `output/{project}/`. This rule governs inputs only.
   - **Operator-pasted content — save verbatim.** When the operator pastes file content and asks you to save it, use `Write` to save exactly as provided. No reformatting, no truncation, no restructuring. If no target path is given, ask before writing. Flag before writing if: target path exists and would be overwritten; content appears incomplete; content conflicts with an approved artifact. Confirm the write by stating target path and line count — do not describe the content.
   - **Exception: legitimate copying.** Copy an input only when (a) the operator explicitly asks for an archival snapshot or reproducibility freeze, or (b) a downstream tool requires the file at a specific path and no symlink or path argument will satisfy it. In both cases, record the absolute source path in the copy's frontmatter or in a sibling `SOURCE.md`, and state in your turn-summary that you copied rather than referenced.

   **Canonical Compaction block** (copy verbatim):

   ```markdown
   ## Compaction

   When `/compact` fires, preserve:
   - The current pipeline/stage identifier and active working directory (which section, which stage, which command is mid-run).
   - Paths to any subagent-output files the main session has not yet read.
   - Any pending operator gate the session is holding at.

   Auto-compact drops these by priority; name them explicitly so they survive. Before `/compact`, prefer writing a short session-state scratchpad (current step, decisions, partial findings, artifact paths) and `/clear` + restart from the scratchpad over lossy auto-summarization.

   **Post-compact resumption — trust the summary.** When resuming after compaction, treat the summary's "commits made" / "files modified" / "decisions" lists as authoritative. Do NOT re-derive them via `git log`, `git show`, or repeated Reads of `session-notes.md`/`decisions.md`. Verify only when the next action requires a specific detail the summary didn't capture (e.g., line numbers for an Edit). Cost test: if your verification doesn't change the next tool call, skip it.
   ```

   **Canonical Session Boundaries block** (copy verbatim):

   ```markdown
   ## Session Boundaries

   When switching between unrelated tasks in the same terminal, prefer `/clear` over continuing in dirty context. Stale context from a prior task compounds and contaminates the next one.
   ```

   **Procedure:**

   ```bash
   CLAUDE_MD="projects/{name}/CLAUDE.md"

   if [ ! -f "$CLAUDE_MD" ]; then
     cat > "$CLAUDE_MD" <<'EOF'
# {name}

{project-description}

## Input File Handling

Input files — context packs, reference documents, source data, prior artifacts the operator drops into the working directory — are read-only references. Use them by path, do not copy or rewrite them.

- **Default to `Read`.** When the operator points you at an input file (whether it lives in the project folder, an `inputs/` sibling, or an absolute path elsewhere on the filesystem), use the `Read` tool against that path. Never invoke `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, or shell file-creation commands (`cp`, `cat >`, `tee`, redirection, `install`, etc.) against a file whose content originated outside the current session.
- **Do not materialize chat content.** If an input's content enters the conversation (pasted, quoted, or summarized), that does not make the chat copy canonical. The file on disk remains the source of truth.
- **Do not co-locate inputs with outputs for "provenance."** If provenance matters, record the absolute path of the input in the artifact's frontmatter or a `sources.md` file — do not duplicate the bytes.
- **Outputs are different.** Artifacts your command is *designed to produce* (plans, specs, drafts, reports) are written normally via `Write` into `output/{project}/`. This rule governs inputs only.
- **Operator-pasted content — save verbatim.** When the operator pastes file content and asks you to save it, use `Write` to save exactly as provided. No reformatting, no truncation, no restructuring. If no target path is given, ask before writing. Flag before writing if: target path exists and would be overwritten; content appears incomplete; content conflicts with an approved artifact. Confirm the write by stating target path and line count — do not describe the content.
- **Exception: legitimate copying.** Copy an input only when (a) the operator explicitly asks for an archival snapshot or reproducibility freeze, or (b) a downstream tool requires the file at a specific path and no symlink or path argument will satisfy it. In both cases, record the absolute source path in the copy's frontmatter or in a sibling `SOURCE.md`, and state in your turn-summary that you copied rather than referenced.

This rule mirrors the canonical `Input File Handling` section in the workspace-level `CLAUDE.md`. It is repeated here because projects are sometimes opened without the parent workspace context loaded.

## Commit Rules

**Commit directly. Do not ask for permission.** After completing approved work, stage the relevant files and commit in a single step using a heredoc commit message. Do not run `git status`, `git diff`, or `git status --short` as pre-commit checks or post-commit verification — the filesystem is the source of truth for what you just changed.

Do not push. Pushing is a manual operator step. After committing, remind the operator to push and to run `/wrap-session` if the work is complete. Never commit files that may contain secrets (`.env`, credentials, tokens).

This rule mirrors the canonical `Commit behavior` section in the workspace-level `CLAUDE.md`. It is repeated here because projects are sometimes opened without the parent workspace context loaded.

## Compaction

When `/compact` fires, preserve:
- The current pipeline/stage identifier and active working directory (which section, which stage, which command is mid-run).
- Paths to any subagent-output files the main session has not yet read.
- Any pending operator gate the session is holding at.

Auto-compact drops these by priority; name them explicitly so they survive. Before `/compact`, prefer writing a short session-state scratchpad (current step, decisions, partial findings, artifact paths) and `/clear` + restart from the scratchpad over lossy auto-summarization.

**Post-compact resumption — trust the summary.** When resuming after compaction, treat the summary's "commits made" / "files modified" / "decisions" lists as authoritative. Do NOT re-derive them via `git log`, `git show`, or repeated Reads of `session-notes.md`/`decisions.md`. Verify only when the next action requires a specific detail the summary didn't capture (e.g., line numbers for an Edit). Cost test: if your verification doesn't change the next tool call, skip it.

## Session Boundaries

When switching between unrelated tasks in the same terminal, prefer `/clear` over continuing in dirty context. Stale context from a prior task compounds and contaminates the next one.

   Report in the step output:

4a. **Scaffold `projects/{name}/logs/` with `decisions.md`.** Every project tracks session-level decisions in `logs/decisions.md` (mirror of the ai-resources logs convention; consumed by `/prime` Step 4 and `/wrap-session`). Create the directory and a minimal scaffold file. Idempotent — skip the write if the file already exists, but still ensure the directory is present.

   ```bash
   LOGS_DIR="projects/{name}/logs"
   mkdir -p "$LOGS_DIR"

   if [ ! -f "$LOGS_DIR/decisions.md" ]; then
     cat > "$LOGS_DIR/decisions.md" <<'EOF'
# Decisions — {name}

Cross-session decisions log. Newest entries at the bottom (append-only).

Each entry uses the canonical shape:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — {one-line decision title}

**Context.** {what prompted the decision; one short paragraph}

**Decision.** {what was decided; one or two sentences}

**Rationale.** {why this choice over alternatives; one paragraph}

**Alternatives considered.**
- *{alternative 1}:* {one line on why not}
- *{alternative 2}:* {one line on why not}
```
EOF
     # Note: `{name}` is substituted by the calling agent before this bash block
     # executes — same convention as all other `{name}` references in this file.
     echo "Created $LOGS_DIR/decisions.md"
   else
     echo "$LOGS_DIR/decisions.md already present — skipping"
   fi
   ```

   Report in the step output:
   - created `logs/decisions.md` / already present

5. **Initial sync** — run the hook once now so the project starts with all shared commands/agents already linked, instead of waiting for the next session start:

   ```bash
   CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR="projects/{name}" bash ai-resources/.claude/hooks/auto-sync-shared.sh
   ```

5a. **Canonical command verification.** After the initial sync, verify the minimum-required canonical commands are present in `projects/{name}/.claude/commands/`. The auto-sync hook should have installed all of these — this step is a safety-net that catches regressions in the hook's exclusion logic or in the project's `shared-manifest.json`.

   Required canonical commands (every project must have these on session 1):
   - `prime.md` — session orientation
   - `wrap-session.md` — session closeout
   - `session-start.md` — Phase-3 mandate capture
   - `session-plan.md` — session-orchestration planning
   - `open-items.md` — backlog inventory
   - `qc-pass.md` — independent QC pass
   - `resolve.md` — QC-finding triage and resolution
   - `clarify.md` — request-clarification structured prompt
   - `scope.md` — scope-summary generator
   - `recommend.md` — operator-defers-to-Claude self-decision path

   ```bash
   MISSING=()
   for cmd in prime wrap-session session-start session-plan open-items qc-pass resolve clarify scope recommend; do
     if [ ! -L "projects/{name}/.claude/commands/${cmd}.md" ] && [ ! -f "projects/{name}/.claude/commands/${cmd}.md" ]; then
       MISSING+=("${cmd}.md")
     fi
   done

   if [ ${#MISSING[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
     echo "WARN: ${#MISSING[@]} canonical command(s) missing after initial sync:"
     printf '  - %s\n' "${MISSING[@]}"
     echo ""
     echo "Re-run the auto-sync hook manually:"
     echo "  CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR=\"projects/{name}\" bash ai-resources/.claude/hooks/auto-sync-shared.sh"
     echo ""
     echo "If the commands remain missing after the manual re-run, investigate:"
     echo "  - projects/{name}/.claude/shared-manifest.json — check commands.local for accidental inclusions"
     echo "  - ai-resources/.claude/hooks/auto-sync-shared.sh — check the baked-in exclusion list"
   else
     echo "All 10 canonical commands present."
   fi
   ```

   Report in the step output:
   - canonical commands status: all present / N missing (named) + remediation hint emitted

### Report

Report what was created: manifest path, settings.json modifications (permissions block, SessionStart hook, `additionalDirectories` grant), CLAUDE.md state (created / appended / already present), `logs/decisions.md` scaffold (created / already present), the list of files the initial sync symlinked, and the canonical command verification result (all 10 present / N missing). Do not commit — the operator reviews the enrichment alongside the pipeline output. From this point on, any new command added to `ai-resources/.claude/commands/` will be available in this project on the next session start automatically, and skills under `ai-resources/skills/` are reachable via the filesystem grant.

## Key Rules

- Never advance a stage without user confirmation (`NEXT`)
- Never modify decisions.md without user confirmation
- Always announce which stage is running and what it expects as input
- When spawning any subagent, always include in the spawn prompt: "Project directory: projects/{project-name}/ — Pipeline directory: projects/{project-name}/pipeline/"
- The `pipeline/pipeline-state.md` file is the source of truth for pipeline progress — always read it before taking action, always update it after state changes. Pipeline artifacts live in `pipeline/`: `context-pack.md`, `project-plan.md`, and (optionally) `technical-spec.md` are **discovered inputs** copied from `projects/project-planning/output/{name}/` at First Run; `repo-snapshot.md`, `architecture.md`, `implementation-spec.md`, `implementation-log.md`, and `test-results.md` are **pipeline-generated outputs**. Provenance for the discovered inputs is recorded in `pipeline/sources.md`. Only the project's working files live at the project root.
- If the project involves creating new skills, inform the user that skill creation must use the `/create-skill` command from ai-resources. Ensure ai-resources is connected via `--add-dir` so the command is available.
