model: opus

Run the full repo due diligence pipeline: audit the workspace, compare to the previous audit, triage findings, and fix what's approved. Optionally continue into a deep operational assessment.

Input: $ARGUMENTS (optional) — depth control:
- (empty): factual audit only (Steps 1-6)
- "deep": factual audit + operational assessment with judgment and recommendations (Steps 1-6, then 7-13)
- "full": factual audit + operational assessment + pipeline testing (Steps 1-6, then 7-14)

---

### Step 1: Scope Selection [Operator Gate]

1. Set WORKSPACE to the Axcion AI workspace root (parent of `ai-resources/`).
2. Enumerate the contents of `{WORKSPACE}/projects/` so you can list real project names.
3. Ask the operator which scope to audit. Present a numbered list:
   - **1. Workspace** (default) — full Axcion AI workspace: ai-resources, workflows, all projects
   - **2. ai-resources** — only the ai-resources repo
   - **3. workflows** — only the workflows repo
   - **4. A specific project** — followed by the enumerated list from `projects/`, each as its own numbered sub-option (e.g., `4a. projects/obsidian-pe-kb`, `4b. projects/buy-side-service-plan`, etc.)

4. Wait for the operator's answer. Accept numeric, letter, or name-based responses.

5. Based on the response, set three variables:
   - **AUDIT_ROOT** — the filesystem subtree to audit:
     - Workspace: `{WORKSPACE}`
     - ai-resources: `{WORKSPACE}/ai-resources`
     - workflows: `{WORKSPACE}/workflows`
     - projects/X: `{WORKSPACE}/projects/X`
   - **SCOPE_SLUG** — used in report filenames (empty string for workspace; otherwise a kebab-case identifier like `ai-resources`, `workflows`, or `project-obsidian-pe-kb`)
   - **SCOPE_LABEL** — human-readable for the report header (e.g., "Axcion AI Workspace (multi-repo)", "ai-resources repo", "workflows repo", "projects/obsidian-pe-kb")

---

### Step 2: Preparation

6. Set AUDIT_DIR to `{WORKSPACE}/ai-resources/audits/` (audit reports always land in the central audits directory regardless of scope).
7. Set REPORT_PATH:
   - If SCOPE_SLUG is empty: `{AUDIT_DIR}/repo-due-diligence-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Otherwise: `{AUDIT_DIR}/repo-due-diligence-YYYY-MM-DD-{SCOPE_SLUG}.md`
8. Find PREVIOUS_AUDIT — the most recent prior audit **with the same scope**:
   - If SCOPE_SLUG is empty: match `repo-due-diligence-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (no trailing slug, no `-partial`). Regex: `^repo-due-diligence-\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\.md$`.
   - Otherwise: match `repo-due-diligence-YYYY-MM-DD-{SCOPE_SLUG}.md`. Regex: `^repo-due-diligence-\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}-{SCOPE_SLUG}\.md$`.
   - Set PREVIOUS_AUDIT to the newest matching file, or "None" if no prior scoped audit exists.

---

### Step 3: Delegate Factual Audit to Subagent

9. **Launch the `repo-dd-auditor` subagent.** Pass it:
   - WORKSPACE path (full workspace, for cross-reference context)
   - AUDIT_ROOT path (the subtree to actually walk)
   - SCOPE_LABEL (for the report header)
   - AUDIT_DIR path
   - PREVIOUS_AUDIT path (or "None")
   - REPORT_PATH
   - DEPTH: "standard", "deep", or "full" based on $ARGUMENTS

   The subagent reads the questionnaire, executes it against AUDIT_ROOT, and saves the report. This ensures the factual audit runs with fresh context and no bias from recent session work.

10. When the subagent returns, verify the report was written by checking that REPORT_PATH exists. Do not read the full report into main-session context — the dd-extract-agent (next step) will do that.

---

### Step 3b: Delegate Triage Extraction to Subagent

11. **Launch the `dd-extract-agent` subagent.** Pass it:
    - DD_REPORT = REPORT_PATH (the audit just written)
    - EXTRACT_PATH = `{AUDIT_DIR}/working/dd-extract.md`
    - DEPTH ($ARGUMENTS-derived value: "standard", "deep", or "full")

    The subagent reads the full DD_REPORT once, writes a structured extract, and returns the extract path plus a finding count. This avoids re-reading the full report in Steps 14 and 33.

12. Set EXTRACT_PATH to the path returned by the subagent.

---

### Step 4: Triage Findings

14. Read EXTRACT_PATH (the structured extract from Step 11), not DD_REPORT.
15. Iterate the Findings section of the extract. Each line is one finding to triage.
16. Categorize each finding into exactly one of:

**AUTO-FIX** — The fix is unambiguous and self-contained. It touches exactly one file, requires no judgment about intent, and cannot cascade into other references. Examples: creating a missing directory with .gitkeep, fixing a broken symlink where the intended target is obvious. If the fix *might* require checking downstream references or choosing between approaches, it is OPERATOR, not AUTO-FIX.

**OPERATOR** — Everything that requires a decision, including anything where the "right" fix is ambiguous. This is the default category. When in doubt, classify as OPERATOR. Examples: resolving contradictions between CLAUDE.md files, migrating a skill to a different location, choosing whether to update or remove a stale file, fixing a diverged copy where it's unclear which version is correct.

**INFO** — Findings that are purely inventory or measurement. No action implied. Examples: total skill count, context load line counts, CLAUDE.md growth trends, clean checks that found nothing.

---

### Step 5: Present Findings [Operator Gate]

17. Display a summary table:

```
AUTO-FIX:  X items
OPERATOR:  Y items
INFO:      Z items
```

18. List each AUTO-FIX item with:
    - What the finding is (one line)
    - What the fix would be (one line)

19. List each OPERATOR item with:
    - What the finding is (one line)
    - What decision is needed (one line)

20. If there are no AUTO-FIX or OPERATOR items (all findings are INFO): state "Clean audit — no actionable findings" and skip to Step 7.

21. **Wait for operator approval before proceeding.** The operator may:
    - Approve all auto-fixes and select which operator items to fix
    - Approve some and defer others
    - Defer all fixes to a fresh session (the audit report is already saved)
    - Request changes to the triage categorization

---

### Step 6: Apply Fixes

22. Apply each approved fix.
23. After each fix, verify the change by reading the modified file.
24. Keep a running log of changes made (file path, what changed).
25. If context usage is high, inform the operator — they can choose to stop and continue fixes in a fresh session using the audit report as reference.

---

### Step 7: Commit

26. Stage the audit report file (always — even if no fixes were applied, a clean audit is baseline data).
27. If fixes were applied in Step 6, stage those files too.
28. Commit with message format: `audit: repo-dd — YYYY-MM-DD [SCOPE_LABEL, brief scope note]`
    - Example (workspace): `audit: repo-dd — 2026-04-06 full workspace, 3 fixes applied`
    - Example (workspace, clean): `audit: repo-dd — 2026-04-06 full workspace, clean`
    - Example (scoped): `audit: repo-dd — 2026-04-06 projects/obsidian-pe-kb, 2 fixes applied`
    - Note: when AUDIT_ROOT and the fixed files span multiple git repos, commit per repo with a scope note identifying that repo's portion.
29. Do NOT push.
30. If $ARGUMENTS does not contain "deep" or "full", stop here. Present the audit summary to the operator.

▸ **Context checkpoint:** The factual audit has accumulated context. Before proceeding to the deep tier, run `/compact` to clear it.

---

## Deep Operational Assessment

Steps 8-14 run only when $ARGUMENTS contains "deep" or "full". They produce a separate report file that references the factual audit. Evidence and interpretation stay in separate files. When SCOPE_SLUG is non-empty, the deep assessment is narrowed to AUDIT_ROOT — chain analysis, context load assessment, and friction synthesis all operate on the scoped subtree only.

---

### Step 8: Deep Assessment Preparation

31. Set DD_REPORT to the audit report just saved at REPORT_PATH.
32. Set DEEP_REPORT_PATH:
    - If SCOPE_SLUG is empty: `{AUDIT_DIR}/repo-dd-deep-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
    - Otherwise: `{AUDIT_DIR}/repo-dd-deep-YYYY-MM-DD-{SCOPE_SLUG}.md`
33. Read EXTRACT_PATH (the structured extract from Step 11) for the deep-tier sections: Section 1.2 (hooks), Section 2 (CLAUDE.md health), Section 3.4 (downstream reference ranking), Section 5.1 (context load), Section 5.2 (unreferenced CLAUDE.md sections). Do not re-read DD_REPORT.
34. **Launch the `dd-log-sweep-agent` subagent.** Pass it:
    - AUDIT_ROOT
    - SWEEP_PATH = `{AUDIT_DIR}/working/log-sweep.md`
    - TODAY (YYYY-MM-DD)

    The subagent discovers log files within AUDIT_ROOT (`logs/friction-log.md`, `logs/improvement-log.md`, `logs/session-notes.md`, `logs/coaching-log.md`, `logs/workflow-observations.md`, `logs/decisions.md`, `logs/innovation-registry.md`), reads them, and writes a structured pattern summary. Returns the sweep path plus pattern counts. Set SWEEP_PATH to the returned value.

---

### Step 9: Feature Criticality Assessment

35. Extract the top-10 downstream reference ranking from EXTRACT_PATH §3.4.
36. For each item in the ranking, classify as:
    - **Load-bearing** — failure breaks multiple commands, pipelines, or session lifecycle flows. Criteria: referenced by 3+ commands/hooks, OR sits in a sequential pipeline where absence blocks downstream stages, OR is the sole source of truth for a shared convention.
    - **Supporting** — failure degrades but does not block. Criteria: referenced by 1-2 commands, has workarounds, or produces optional outputs.
    - **Peripheral** — failure affects only itself. Criteria: no downstream references, or referenced only by its own command.
37. Build an operational dependency graph beyond file references. Trace these chains:
    - Research pipeline: /run-preparation through /produce-knowledge-file
    - Project setup pipeline: /new-project through /session-guide
    - Session lifecycle: /prime → [work] → /wrap-session
    - Skill management: /request-skill → /create-skill → /improve-skill
    - Workflow management: /deploy-workflow → /sync-workflow
    For each chain, identify the single point of failure — the component whose breakage has the widest blast radius.
38. Check for untracked dependencies — features that are load-bearing by convention but not by file reference. Examples: CLAUDE.md behavioral sections that shape every session, symlink conventions that deployments depend on, commit message formats that hooks parse.
39. Cross-reference with EXTRACT_PATH §2 (CLAUDE.md health — enumerated contradictions and dead references) for items in load-bearing files. A contradiction in a load-bearing file is Critical; in a peripheral file, Low.
40. Record all findings for Section 1 of the deep report with priority ratings (Critical / High / Medium / Low).

---

### Step 10: Context Management Assessment

41. Extract Section 5.1 (context load per entry point) and Section 5.2 (unreferenced CLAUDE.md sections) from EXTRACT_PATH.
42. For each entry point, assess context efficiency:
    - Calculate the ratio of operationally-referenced lines (sections referenced by commands/hooks) to total lines.
    - Flag entry points where less than 60% of loaded context is operationally referenced.
43. Identify CLAUDE.md sections that could move to on-demand references. Candidates are sections that:
    - Are not referenced by any command, hook, or agent definition
    - AND are not behavioral modifiers that need to be present in every session (judgment call — state your reasoning)
    - AND exceed 5 lines
    For each candidate, state: section name, line count, current file, and whether it could be loaded via a skill reference or command preamble instead.
44. Assess hook density per entry point. For each settings.json with hooks:
    - Count hooks per trigger type (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionStart, Stop, UserPromptSubmit)
    - Estimate cumulative timeout per write operation (sum of PostToolUse Write hook timeouts)
    - Flag configurations where a single Write operation triggers 3+ hooks
45. For each hook, assess usage evidence:
    - Read the hook script (if external) and determine what it produces
    - Check whether its output is consumed by any command or read by the operator
    - Flag hooks whose output goes to files that are never read by commands (potential dead hooks)
46. Identify context that loads but is rarely used. Check:
    - SessionStart hooks that load content — is that content referenced in patterns visible in session-notes.md?
    - CLAUDE.md sections about features not mentioned in the last 30 days of session notes
47. Record all findings for Section 2 of the deep report with priority ratings.

---

### Step 11: Friction and Improvement Synthesis

48. Read SWEEP_PATH (the structured log-sweep summary from Step 34). Do not re-read the raw logs — the sweep agent already extracted the patterns.
49. The sweep summary is structured into sections matching the synthesis categories: Discovered Logs, Recurring Friction, Unresolved Improvements, Friction Without Improvement, Improvement Without Verification, Cross-Repo Patterns, Innovation Triage Backlog, Recent-Decision Impact. Iterate each section.
50. (Reserved — log discovery and reading are now performed by the sweep agent in Step 34.)
51. (Reserved — log discovery and reading are now performed by the sweep agent in Step 34.)
52. Adopt the sweep agent's pattern identifications as the working set:
    - **Recurring friction** — from the Recurring Friction section.
    - **Unresolved improvements** — from the Unresolved Improvements section.
    - **Friction without improvement** — from the Friction Without Improvement section.
    - **Improvement without verification** — from the Improvement Without Verification section.
    - **Cross-repo patterns** — from the Cross-Repo Patterns section.
53. For each pattern surfaced by the sweep, draft a specific recommendation:
    - What the friction is (evidence: file path, entry text, frequency)
    - Root cause assessment (tool gap, process gap, context gap, or operator habit)
    - Recommended action (create a skill, add a hook, modify a command, change a CLAUDE.md rule, or accept as inherent)
    - Effort estimate (quick fix: <1 session, moderate: 1 session, significant: multi-session)
54. Record all findings for Section 3 of the deep report with priority ratings.

---

### Step 12: Deep Report Generation

55. If context usage is high after completing Step 11, inform the operator — they can choose to save the report with sections completed so far and finish in a fresh session.

56. Write the deep report to DEEP_REPORT_PATH with this structure:

    ```
    # Repo Deep Review — YYYY-MM-DD
    Workspace: Axcion AI
    Scope: {SCOPE_LABEL}
    Based on: repo-dd audit YYYY-MM-DD (same scope)
    ```

    **Section 1: Feature Criticality**
    - 1.1 Load-Bearing Features (table: Feature | Reference Count | Blast Radius | Risk Notes)
    - 1.2 Operational Dependency Chains (structured list per chain, single point of failure marked)
    - 1.3 Untracked Dependencies (table: Dependency | Type | Why It Matters)

    **Section 2: Context Management**
    - 2.1 Context Load Summary (table: Entry Point | CLAUDE.md Lines | Hook Load | Total | Efficiency Ratio)
    - 2.2 Migration Candidates (table: Section | File | Lines | Recommendation | Reasoning)
    - 2.3 Hook Density Assessment (table: Entry Point | Trigger | Hook Count | Cumulative Timeout | Verdict)
    - 2.4 Dead or Low-Value Context (table: Item | Type | Evidence of Non-Use)

    **Section 3: Friction and Improvement Synthesis**
    - 3.1 Recurring Friction Patterns (table: Pattern | Frequency | Repos Affected | Root Cause | Recommendation)
    - 3.2 Improvement Pipeline Health (table: Metric | Value — covering logged, applied, verified, stalled counts)
    - 3.3 Specific Recommendations (numbered list with priority, effort, and action)

    **Section 4: Pipeline Testing**
    - Placeholder: "Not run. Use `/repo-dd full` to include pipeline testing."

    **Summary**
    - Critical findings: {count and one-line each}
    - High findings: {count}
    - Medium findings: {count}
    - Low findings: {count}
    - Top 3 recommendations by impact

57. Every finding in the deep report must have:
    - A priority rating: Critical / High / Medium / Low
    - Evidence citation: file path(s), log entry text, or metric values
    - A specific recommendation (not "consider reviewing" — state what to do)
58. Cross-check: no finding should duplicate a factual audit finding without adding new interpretation. The deep review adds judgment; the audit provides facts.
59. If any section has zero findings, state: "No issues identified. Checked: {describe what was examined}."
60. Save the deep report.

▸ **Context checkpoint:** Before pipeline testing, run `/compact` to clear the deep assessment context.

---

### Step 13: Pipeline Testing [Operator Gate]

61. If $ARGUMENTS does not contain "full", skip to Step 14.
62. **Test 1: Symlink resolution.** Check every symlink recorded in EXTRACT_PATH §1.7. For each: does the target exist? Is it readable? Is the content non-empty? Record pass/fail per symlink.
63. **Test 2: Template sync.** For each file that exists as both a canonical version (in ai-resources/skills/ or ai-resources/workflows/) and a deployed copy (in projects/), compare content. Record: identical, diverged (with line diff count), or missing copy.
64. **Test 3: /deploy-workflow preconditions.** Verify without executing:
    - Template directory exists at ai-resources/workflows/research-workflow/
    - SETUP.md exists and contains placeholder definitions
    - Placeholder patterns (search for `{{`) are present in template files
    - Skill symlink source directory (ai-resources/skills/) exists and is non-empty
    Record: all preconditions met / list failures.
65. **Test 4: /new-project preconditions.** Verify without executing:
    - All pipeline-stage-* agent files exist in ai-resources/.claude/agents/
    - session-guide-generator agent file exists
    Record: all preconditions met / list failures.
66. **Test 5: /sync-workflow preconditions.** Verify without executing:
    - At least one deployed project exists under projects/
    - Template directory at ai-resources/workflows/research-workflow/.claude/ contains commands, agents, or hooks directories
    Record: all preconditions met / list failures.
67. Read the deep report at DEEP_REPORT_PATH. Replace the Section 4 placeholder with the pipeline testing results. Update the Summary finding counts to include any pipeline test failures. Save.

---

### Step 14: Commit Deep Report

68. Stage the deep report file at DEEP_REPORT_PATH.
69. Commit with message format: `audit: repo-dd-deep — YYYY-MM-DD [SCOPE_LABEL, brief scope note]`
    - Example (workspace): `audit: repo-dd-deep — 2026-04-06 full workspace, 12 findings`
    - Example (workspace, full): `audit: repo-dd-deep — 2026-04-06 full workspace + pipeline tests, 8 findings`
    - Example (scoped): `audit: repo-dd-deep — 2026-04-06 projects/obsidian-pe-kb, 5 findings`
70. Do NOT push.
71. Present the Summary section of the deep report to the operator as final output.
