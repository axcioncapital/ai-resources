Investigate dirty paths in the git working tree, plan a safe cleanup with independent QC and triage, and execute behind hard gates for irreversible operations.

Input: $ARGUMENTS (optional) — any operator notes about what triggered the cleanup, what to prioritize, or which files to handle specially. Treated as the "original operator request" recorded in the plan file Section 1. If empty, use the operator's invocation statement as the request.

**This command is not a trivial wrapper.** It encodes the invocation contract for `worktree-cleanup-investigator`: mandatory plan mode, independent QC subagents (first QC always; second QC required unless the quick-tier skip applies — see Step 9) with triage between them, hard gates with named confirmation phrases, execution-time re-verification guards, post-commit filesystem verification. Deviating from the sequence is a safety failure. Read the skill's SKILL.md; load reference files on demand per Step 3.

---

## Step 1: Verify prerequisites

**Concurrent-session disclosure (mandatory, run before any other prereq).** Ask the operator: "Is any other Claude Code session currently active on this repo or on this machine? (yes/no)". If yes, STOP and instruct the operator to wrap or close the other session(s) first, then re-invoke. `/cleanup-worktree` commits and untracks files — running it concurrently with another session can clobber that session's in-flight work. Do not attempt a programmatic process check (`pgrep` and equivalents return false positives because Claude Code spawns helper processes within a single session); operator disclosure is the contract per workspace `CLAUDE.md → Concurrent-session staging discipline`. If no, proceed to item 1 below.

1. Confirm `ai-resources/` is mounted — required because `worktree-cleanup-investigator` depends on `find-template.sh` walking up from CWD to find the `ai-resources` sibling. If `ai-resources/` is not accessible from the current working directory, STOP and surface to the operator — do not attempt a text-based fallback for template detection.
2. Confirm git state is clean-baseline — run `git status` and check for in-progress rebase, merge conflict, or detached HEAD. If any of those apply, STOP and instruct the operator to resolve the underlying state first.
3. Locate the skill: `ai-resources/skills/worktree-cleanup-investigator/SKILL.md`. If missing, STOP — the command cannot run without the skill.

## Step 2: Enter plan mode

4. Enter plan mode immediately. All subsequent steps up through Step 9 run in plan mode. No mutations to the working tree, the index, the filesystem, or `.gitignore` occur before `ExitPlanMode` is called in Step 10.
5. Read-only operations permitted throughout: `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Bash` for `git status`, `git diff`, `git log`, `cat`, `ls`, and `scripts/find-template.sh`. Every other tool is off-limits until plan mode exits.

## Step 3: Load the skill (on-demand reference loading)

6. Read `ai-resources/skills/worktree-cleanup-investigator/SKILL.md` in full.
7. Do NOT pre-load the reference files. The two references (`decision-taxonomy.md`, `execution-protocol.md`) are loaded at their specific trigger points:
   - `decision-taxonomy.md` — load in Step 4, immediately before beginning per-path classification. Read sections as needed; the TOC supports grep-based section-level reads.
   - `execution-protocol.md` — load sections on demand: § 1 + "Plan file schema" in Step 5 (writing the plan); § 3 / § 4 / § 6 in Steps 6 / 7 / 9 (each QC or triage subagent launch); § 7 + § 8 in Step 11 (before each destructive operation); § 11 when finalizing the commit split in the plan. Do not read the full reference at Step 3 "just in case".

This on-demand loading matches `SKILL.md → Reference Files` and keeps the main session lean across the 45–90 min workflow.

## Step 4: Investigate dirty paths

9. Run `git status --porcelain=v1` and capture the full output.
10. For each dirty path in the output, apply the investigation protocol from `execution-protocol.md` section 2:
    - Read the file content (`Read` — actually open it, do not classify from filename). For deleted paths (status codes `D` or `AD`, where the file no longer exists on disk), use `git show HEAD:<path>` to recover the last-tracked content. Do not skip the read step for deletions — classification still requires inspecting what was deleted.
    - Note the git status code.
    - **Run `find-template.sh` for every path that could plausibly have a canonical template elsewhere in `ai-resources/`.** This includes (but is not limited to) `.claude/commands/*.md`, `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/hooks/*`, and any path whose directory structure mirrors a known `ai-resources/` subdirectory (skills/, prompts/, workflows/, scripts/, docs/). Never check subdirectories manually — the script mechanically walks all ai-resources locations and is the root-cause fix for the false-negative class. If the script exits with code 3 (ERROR), STOP and surface to operator.
    - Check `.gitignore` interactions.
    - Check for canonical-destination content (CLAUDE.md, user-scoped memory, reference files) if the file carries rules, rationale, or operational knowledge.
    - Assign a decision from `decision-taxonomy.md`.
11. Apply all four bias counters from the skill explicitly: (1) never fabricate file details — re-read files before making any factual claim; (2) always run `find-template.sh` — never check ai-resources subdirectories manually; (3) the second QC pass is required unless the rule-based quick-tier skip applies (zero hard gates AND zero new file-content claims in the revision — Step 9). An operator-requested skip is always refused; (4) hard gates require named confirmation phrases — "ok" / "proceed" / "sure" do NOT clear a gate.

▸ **Compact breakpoint (pre-plan).** Investigation is complete and the plan has not yet been written. If context usage is above ~50%, write a short scratchpad naming: every dirty path with its assigned decision, all `find-template.sh` verdicts, any canonical-destination candidates already identified, and the path to this command's arguments. Then prefer `/clear` + restart (reading the scratchpad) over `/compact`. If neither is needed, continue. See workspace `CLAUDE.md → Working Principles` → pre-compact checkpoint.

## Step 5: Write the plan file

12. Write the plan to `~/.claude/plans/cleanup-worktree-<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>.md`, following the eight-section schema defined in `execution-protocol.md` → "Plan file schema":
    1. Original operator request (from $ARGUMENTS or the invocation statement)
    2. Git status snapshot (raw output from Step 4 step 9)
    3. Per-path classification table (path, status, decision, evidence, gate?, commit group)
    4. Hard-gate inventory (one block per gate: operation, files affected, confirmation phrase, abort scope, justification)
    5. Commit split (ordered list: #, subject, paths, depends on, gate reference)
    6. Execution-time re-verification checklist (one line per destructive operation)
    7. Bias-counter checklist (declared acknowledgment)
    8. Revision history (initially empty)
13. A plan missing any section is structurally invalid. Before proceeding, verify all eight sections are present AND cross-check that every irreversible operation is gated: scan Sections 3 (per-path classification) and 5 (commit split) for any decision of `delete`, `convert-to-symlink` (type change via `rm` + `ln -s`), `migrate-then-delete` (the delete step), or `git rm --cached` paired with filesystem removal. Every such operation MUST appear as a hard-gate block in Section 4. An ungated irreversible operation is a structural failure — fix before the first QC pass, not after.
13b. Populate Section 7 (bias-counter checklist) with an enumerated acknowledgment of all four bias counters: (1) "Counter 1 — files re-read before classification on YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (no claims from filename alone)"; (2) "Counter 2 — find-template.sh run for paths: \<list>"; (3) "Counter 3 — second QC pass scheduled in Step 9 (or quick-tier skip to be evaluated at Step 9 per the condition check in `execution-protocol.md` § 6)"; (4) "Counter 4 — confirmation phrases declared in Section 4 hard-gate blocks". Section 7 is the audit artifact the QC subagents verify against. An empty Section 7 is a structural failure.

## Step 6: First QC pass (independent subagent)

14. Spawn a QC subagent. Subagent type: `qc-reviewer` (or `qc-gate` if the current project provides that alias in `.claude/agents/`). Mirror the path-passing + write-to-disk contract already used by `repo-dd-auditor` and `token-audit-auditor`.
15. Inputs the subagent receives:
    - **`PLAN_PATH`** — absolute path to the plan file written in Step 5. The subagent reads the plan at invocation time. Do NOT paste the plan content into the subagent brief. Path-passing satisfies the workspace `CLAUDE.md → Input File Handling` rule and preserves context isolation (the subagent still does not see the creation conversation).
    - The original operator request (Section 1 of the plan) — quoted inline in the subagent brief.
    - The git status snapshot (Section 2 of the plan) — quoted inline in the subagent brief.
    - The evaluation criteria: structural completeness (all 8 sections present), factual accuracy (claims about files match file content), gate coverage (every irreversible operation has a hard-gate block), abort-scope completeness (every gate specifies what other sub-steps survive a decline).
16. Inputs the subagent does NOT receive: this conversation, the creation context, any private reasoning about why decisions were made. Context isolation is enforced by what is withheld, not by in-lining the plan.
17. Output contract — the subagent writes its full QC report to `<PLAN_PATH>.qc-pass-1.md` (same directory as the plan; suffix distinguishes first from second pass), and returns a ≤20-line structured summary plus the absolute path. Capture the summary and the path. Read the full report from disk only if a summary item requires deeper context (e.g., to draft a response during triage). This mirrors `ai-resources/CLAUDE.md → Subagent Contracts`.

## Step 7: Triage pass (independent subagent)

18. Spawn a triage subagent. Subagent type: `triage-reviewer`.
19. Inputs the subagent receives:
    - **`QC_REPORT_PATH`** — absolute path to `<PLAN_PATH>.qc-pass-1.md` written by the Step 6 subagent. The triage subagent reads the report at invocation time.
    - **`PLAN_PATH`** — absolute path to the plan file. Read at invocation time.
    - Your proposed responses to each QC finding (one per finding: "will fix", "will clarify", "history-only", or "disagree — defend"). Passed inline in the subagent brief; short enough that inlining is cheaper than writing a response file.
20. Inputs NOT received: the creation conversation.
21. Output contract — the subagent writes its full triage report to `<PLAN_PATH>.triage.md` and returns a ≤20-line summary categorizing findings as must-fix / should-fix / history-only plus any first-class alternatives surfaced. Capture the summary and the path.

▸ **Compact breakpoint (post-triage).** Triage is complete and revision has not yet started. If context usage is above ~50%, write a scratchpad naming: every must-fix finding with its resolution sketch, every should-fix finding the operator has confirmed, any first-class alternatives adopted, and the paths to the plan, the first QC report, and the triage report. Then prefer `/clear` + restart (reading the scratchpad) over `/compact`. If neither is needed, continue.

## Step 8: Plan revision

22. Revise the plan file to address every must-fix finding from triage and any should-fix findings the operator confirms. Use `Edit` on the plan file only. Do not touch any other file.
23. Append to Section 8 (Revision history) of the plan: each finding, the proposed response, and the exact plan edit that addressed it. **For each revision edit, explicitly annotate whether the edit introduced a new file-content claim** (a new factual assertion about a file's content, date, reference, provenance, or intent that did not appear in the pre-revision plan). This annotation gates the Step 9 quick-tier skip — it cannot be reconstructed after the fact.
24. Re-apply the "never fabricate file details" bias counter to the revision. New content introduced by the revision must be independently verifiable — re-read any file you make factual claims about.

## Step 9: Second QC pass (required unless quick-tier skip applies)

25. **Quick-tier skip check.** Before spawning the second QC subagent, evaluate both conditions:
    (a) Plan Section 4 hard-gate count = **0** (no `delete`, no `convert-to-symlink`, no `migrate-then-delete` deletion step, no paired `git rm --cached` + filesystem removal).
    (b) Revision Section-8 annotations show **zero new file-content claims**.

    If both hold: the 2nd QC may be skipped. Append to plan Section 8: `2nd QC skipped per quick-tier rule. Section 4 hard-gate count: 0. Revision new file-content claims: 0. Justification: <one line>.` Surface the skip to the operator in the next turn-level summary, verbatim: `2nd QC skipped per quick-tier rule — zero hard gates, zero new file-content claims in revision.` The operator sees this before Step 10 `ExitPlanMode`. Then skip to Step 10.

    If either condition fails, or either is ambiguous, run the 2nd QC below — do NOT skip.

26. Spawn a second QC subagent with the same isolation contract as Step 6.
    - Inputs: `PLAN_PATH`, `FIRST_QC_REPORT_PATH` (= `<PLAN_PATH>.qc-pass-1.md`), the original operator request and git status snapshot quoted inline. All paths are read by the subagent at invocation time.
    - Output contract: writes the full 2nd QC report to `<PLAN_PATH>.qc-pass-2.md`, returns the path + ≤20-line summary.
27. Exit criteria:
    - BLOCKING issues found → loop back to Step 8 (revise again). Maximum 2 full revision cycles. On cycle 3, STOP and surface the loop to the operator — there is something structurally wrong with the plan or the approach.
    - Only MINOR issues found → proceed with issues logged in the plan's Section 8.
    - Clean → proceed.

## Step 10: ExitPlanMode and operator approval

28. Call `ExitPlanMode` with the revised plan as the argument. The harness will present the plan to the operator.
29. Wait for explicit operator approval. Do not proceed to execution without it.

## Step 11: Execute commits in order

30. For each commit in Section 5 (Commit split) of the plan, execute in order:
    a. For each destructive operation in this commit, run the execution-time re-verification guard from Section 6 of the plan — immediately before the destructive command, not at investigation time. If the guard fires (diff non-empty, inventory mismatch, git ls-files verdict wrong, etc.), STOP the current commit, surface the guard failure to the operator, and ask how to proceed. Do NOT silently fall back.
    b. For each hard-gate block referenced by this commit (Section 4 of the plan), run the hard-gate protocol:
       - Display the content being destroyed.
       - State the irreversibility.
       - Require the named confirmation phrase verbatim. Generic affirmatives ("ok", "proceed", "sure") DO NOT clear the gate.
       - If the operator declines, apply the abort scope from the gate block exactly as specified. Do not improvise.
    c. After all destructive operations in this commit pass their gates and guards, execute the operations.
    d. Stage the changes with `git add` (specific paths, not `-A`).
    e. Commit with the subject line specified in the plan's Commit split.

31. After each commit lands, run post-commit verification from the filesystem (not `git status` or `git diff`):
    - Read each committed file and confirm content matches intent.
    - For each symlink conversion, `readlink` the symlink and `cat` through it to confirm the target resolves.
    - For each deletion, confirm the path no longer exists on disk.
    - For each `.gitignore` edit, re-read `.gitignore` and confirm the new pattern is present.

## Step 12: Report and wrap

32. Report to the operator:
    - Number of commits landed with hashes and subject lines
    - Hard-gate confirmation phrases received (verbatim, for audit)
    - Any residual unresolved issues from MINOR findings that were logged but not fixed
    - Reminder: "Push manually when ready. Then run `/wrap-session` to log this session's work and decisions."
33. DO NOT push. DO NOT run `/wrap-session` from inside this command. Both are separate manual operator steps.

## Failure escalation

If any step fails in a way not covered by the plan's abort scope:

- **`find-template.sh` exits 3 (ERROR)** — abort the cleanup session entirely. The skill depends on `ai-resources/` being accessible.
- **Second QC pass loops on cycle 3 without convergence** — stop. Surface the loop to the operator. Something structural is wrong with the plan.
- **Hard gate declined and abort scope is ambiguous** — stop the commit. Ask the operator to clarify which sub-steps should still execute.
- **Execution-time re-verification guard fires** — stop the commit. Do not fall back to a safer operation. Surface the guard failure.
- **Working tree becomes dirty from an unexpected source mid-execution** — stop. Something outside the cleanup flow is making changes. Investigate before continuing.
- **Operator requests to skip QC, skip triage, or shorten the review sequence** — REFUSE. Both QC passes and the triage pass are the load-bearing safety property of this command. The only permitted 2nd-QC skip is the rule-based quick-tier skip in Step 9 — which applies automatically when both conditions hold and is logged + operator-notified — not an operator-requested blanket skip. Surface the refusal explicitly ("the second QC pass is required when either a hard gate exists or the revision introduced a new file-content claim — your plan has <which condition>") and continue the protocol as written. If the operator insists after the explanation, surface the risk in writing, only proceed if they confirm they accept responsibility for a cleanup without independent review, and log the exception explicitly in the plan's Section 8 (revision history) so the decision is auditable.

## Not this command's job

- **Pushing to remote.** Push stays manual per project rules.
- **Running `/wrap-session`.** Separate command, separate invocation.
- **Workspace health audit.** Use `/audit-repo`.
- **Structural or judgment audit of repo contents.** Use `/repo-dd`.
- **Creating or modifying skills.** Use `/develop-ai-resource` for a new resource (it qualifies the need, then hands off to the build engine) or `/improve-skill` for a settled improvement to an existing skill.
- **Single-file commits.** Regular commit flow.
- **Running during an active content-production session.** Cleanup is a dedicated session, not a sidebar.
