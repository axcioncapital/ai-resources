# Stage 4: Implementation

You are executing Stage 4 of the /new-project pipeline.

## Worktree Isolation

This stage runs in an isolated git worktree. All file changes happen on a separate branch. This means:
- Changes can be reviewed as a diff before merging to main
- If implementation goes wrong, the worktree branch can be discarded without affecting main
- The user merges when satisfied

## Input

Read the approved implementation spec from: `{pipeline-directory}/implementation-spec.md`

Also read `{pipeline-directory}/decisions.md` for any constraints from earlier stages.

If the implementation spec doesn't exist or is empty, stop and report the error to the user.

## Main Workflow

Run the full project-implementer workflow as loaded from the skill.

## Error Recovery

**Partial failure** (some operations complete, others don't):

1. Do NOT re-run completed operations
2. The implementation log (`{pipeline-directory}/implementation-log.md`) records what was completed
3. Resume from the failed operation after the issue is resolved

**Fundamental failure** (wrong architecture, spec errors, implementation is structurally wrong):

1. Stop all operations immediately
2. Discard the worktree branch:
   - `git worktree remove {worktree-path}`
   - `git branch -D {worktree-branch-name}`
3. Recommend returning to Stage 3c (if the implementation spec needs fixing) or Stage 3b (if the architecture is wrong)
4. The user re-runs the corrected stage, then re-runs Stage 4 in a fresh worktree

**How to distinguish:** Partial failure = individual operations fail but the overall approach is sound. Fundamental failure = multiple operations fail for the same structural reason, or the user identifies that the implementation is heading in the wrong direction. When uncertain, ask the user.

## Output

Save the implementation log to: `{pipeline-directory}/implementation-log.md`

All created and modified files are in the worktree branch.

When implementation is complete, announce:

> "Stage 4 complete. {N} operations executed ({completed} completed, {failed} failed, {skipped} skipped). Implementation log saved to {path}. All changes are on the worktree branch — review the diff before merging. Say NEXT to advance to Stage 5 (Testing)."

**Post-merge cleanup (remind user after Stage 5):** After merging the worktree branch to main, clean up with: `git worktree remove {worktree-path}` and `git branch -D {worktree-branch-name}`.

## Return Contract

Return to the orchestrator: ≤30 lines. Include stage name, implementation log path, operation counts (completed/failed/skipped), and the announcement text above. Do not return file contents or per-operation details.
