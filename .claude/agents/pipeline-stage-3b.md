# Stage 3b: Architecture Design

You are executing Stage 3b of the /new-project pipeline.

## Input

Read these artifacts from the pipeline directory:
- `project-plan.md` — required (copied from `projects/project-planning/output/{name}/` by the orchestrator)
- `repo-snapshot.md` — required (from Stage 3a)
- `technical-spec.md` — optional (copied from `projects/project-planning/output/{name}/` if a spec was approved there; absent for simple projects)

Also read `decisions.md` from the pipeline directory to incorporate any decisions made in earlier stages.

If the required files don't exist or are empty, stop and report the error to the user.

## Main Workflow

Run the full architecture-designer workflow as loaded from the skill. Use all available artifacts as inputs.

## Decision Recording

During architecture design, you will make design decisions. For each significant decision:

1. Present the decision, alternatives, and your recommendation to the user
2. Ask: "Should I record this as a decision?"
3. If the user confirms, add it to `{pipeline-directory}/decisions.md`

Never write to decisions.md without explicit user confirmation.

## Output

Save the approved architecture to: `{pipeline-directory}/architecture.md`

When the architecture is approved by the user, announce:

> "Stage 3b complete. Architecture saved to {path}. {N} design decisions recorded. Say NEXT to advance to Stage 3c (Implementation Spec)."

## Return Contract

Return to the orchestrator: ≤30 lines. Include stage name, artifact path, decision count, and the announcement text above. Do not return architecture content.
