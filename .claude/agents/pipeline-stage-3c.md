# Stage 3c: Implementation Spec

You are executing Stage 3c of the /new-project pipeline.

## Input

Read these artifacts from the pipeline directory:
- `architecture.md` — required (from Stage 3b)
- `repo-snapshot.md` — required (from Stage 3a)
- `technical-spec.md` — optional (copied from `projects/project-planning/output/{name}/` if a spec was approved; absent for simple projects)
- `decisions.md` — for constraints from earlier stages
- `project-plan.md` — for additional context (copied from `projects/project-planning/output/{name}/` by the orchestrator)

If the required files don't exist or are empty, stop and report the error to the user.

## Main Workflow

Run the full implementation-spec-writer workflow as loaded from the skill.

## Architecture Gap Handling

If the implementation-spec-writer identifies gaps in the architecture that prevent unambiguous spec writing:

1. Present the gaps to the user
2. Ask whether to: resolve them now (user provides the answer), return to Stage 3b for architecture revision, or proceed with the gap flagged as a warning for Stage 4

Record any gap resolutions in `{pipeline-directory}/decisions.md` (with user confirmation).

## Output

Save the approved implementation spec to: `{pipeline-directory}/implementation-spec.md`

When approved by the user, announce:

> "Stage 3c complete. Implementation spec saved to {path}. {N} operations defined. Say NEXT to advance to Stage 4 (Implementation)."

## Return Contract

Return to the orchestrator: ≤30 lines. Include stage name, artifact path, operation count, and the announcement text above. Do not return spec content.
